Lipid nanoparticle formulation
The corresponding IL, 18:1 Δ9-cis phosphoethanolamine (DOPE),
cholesterol, and 14:0 PEG2000 phosphoethanolamine (C14-PEG2000)
were dissolved in ethanol at a molar ratio of 35:16:46.5:2.5, respectively,
to form the organic phase of the formulation. For the B10 formulation,
a molar ratio of 40:30:25:2.5 was used. The SM-102 LNP was
prepared using SM-102, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DSPC), cholesterol, and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene
glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG2000) at a molar ratio of
50:10:38.5:1.5, respectively. The ALC-0315 LNPwas formulated via ALC-
0315, DSPC, cholesterol, and ALC-0159 at a molar ratio of
46.3:9.4:42.7:1.6, respectively. The aqueous phase was prepared by
dissolving the corresponding mRNA in a 10mM citrate buffer at pH 3
(Teknova, Hollister, CA, USA). For each mRNA LNP, the weight ratio of
the mRNA to IL was 1:10, and the volume ratio of the organic phase to
aqueous phase was 1:3. Each phase was loaded in separate glass syringes
(Hamilton Company, Reno,NV) and connected to a Pump 33 DDS
syringe pump(HarvardApparatus,MA,USA) attached to amicrofluidic
device with a staggered herringbone micromixer design. The microfluidic
devices were fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane utilizing standard
soft lithographic procedures39. A two-step exposure process was
used to create the SU-8 master with positive channel features on a
silicon wafer, where each mixing channel is 4 cm in length. The syringes
were injected at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min and 1.8mL/min for the
organic phase and aqueous phase, respectively.
For LNPs encapsulating RNP complex, the aqueous phase contained
a solution of pH 7.4 1X PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the
RNP cargo. RNPs were formed by adding TrueCut Cas9 protein
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sgRNA in a 1:1 molar ratio, where the
sgRNA targeted both the upstream and downstream LoxP sites in the
Ai9 cassette. Cas9 and sgRNA were allowed to sit at roomtemperature
for 20min to allow time for the RNP complexes to form, before
microfluidicmixing of the two phases. The ethanol phase consisted of
the corresponding IL, DOPE, cholesterol, C14-PEG2000, and 1,2-dioleoyl-
3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) at a molar ratio of
10.0:11.5:30.0:1.00:16.0, respectively. RNP loading is based on a weight
ratio of 15:1 corresponding to the ratio of total lipids and the amount of
RNP, respectively.
LNPs for TTR gene editing were prepared using a NanoAssemblr
Ignite (Precision Nanosystems, Vancouver, BC, Canada) using the
excipient and buffer conditions described above. Here, Becton Dickinson
(Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) conventional Leur-Lok syringes were
used at a flow rate of 12mL/min into an Ignite NxGen cartridge (Precision
Nanosystems).
All LNPs dialyzed against pH7.4 1X PBS in 20 kDaMWCOcassettes
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for at least 2 h,were passed through 0.22 μm
syringe filters (Genesee Scientific, El Cajon, CA, USA), and stored at
4 °C until further use. For the TTR gene editing studies, LNPs were
concentrated by transferring them to Amicon 50k regenerated cellulose
centrifugal filters (Millipore Sigma) and centrifuging at 700 × g
until the desired volume was reached.
