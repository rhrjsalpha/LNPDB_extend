FIELD OF DISCLOSURE
[0003]
The present disclosure provides novel compounds, compositions comprising such compounds, and methods involving lipid nanoparticle compositions to deliver one or more therapeutic and/or prophylactics to and/or produce polypeptides in mammalian cells or organs. In addition to a novel lipid, lipid nanoparticle compositions of the disclosure may include one or more cationic and/or ionizable amino lipids, phospholipids including polyunsaturated lipids, PEG lipids, structural lipids, and/or therapeutic and/or prophylactics in specific fractions.
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0004]
The effective targeted delivery of biologically active substances such as small molecule drugs, proteins, and nucleic acids represents a continuing medical challenge. In particular, the delivery of nucleic acids to cells is made difficult by the relative instability and low cell permeability of such species. Thus, there exists a need to develop methods and compositions to facilitate the delivery of therapeutic and/or prophylactics such as nucleic acids to cells.
[0005]
Lipid-containing nanoparticle compositions, liposomes, and lipoplexes have proven effective as transport vehicles into cells and/or intracellular compartments for biologically active substances such as small molecule drugs, proteins, and nucleic acids. Such compositions generally include one or more “cationic” and/or amino (ionizable) lipids, phospholipids including polyunsaturated lipids, structural lipids (e.g., sterols), and/or lipids containing polyethylene glycol (PEG lipids). Cationic and/or ionizable lipids include, for example, amine-containing lipids that can be readily protonated. Though a variety of such lipid-containing nanoparticle compositions have been demonstrated, improvements in safety, efficacy, and specificity are still lacking.

About, Approximately: As used herein, the terms “approximately” and “about,” as applied to one or more values of interest, refer to a value that is similar to a stated reference value. In certain embodiments, the term “approximately” or “about” refers to a range of values that fall within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or less than) of the stated reference value unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the context (except where such number would exceed 100% of a possible value). For example, when used in the context of an amount of a given compound in a lipid component of a nanoparticle composition, “about” may mean+/−10% of the recited value. For instance, a nanoparticle composition including a lipid component having about 40% of a given compound may include 30-50% of the compound.
[0261]
As used herein, the term “compound,” is meant to include all isomers and isotopes of the structure depicted. “Isotopes” refers to atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers resulting from a different number of neutrons in the nuclei. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Further, a compound, salt, or complex of the present disclosure can be prepared in combination with solvent or water molecules to form solvates and hydrates by routine methods.
[0262]
As used herein, the term “contacting” means establishing a physical connection between two or more entities. For example, contacting a mammalian cell with a nanoparticle composition means that the mammalian cell and a nanoparticle are made to share a physical connection. Methods of contacting cells with external entities both in vivo and ex vivo are well known in the biological arts. For example, contacting a nanoparticle composition and a mammalian cell disposed within a mammal may be performed by varied routes of administration (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, and subcutaneous) and may involve varied amounts of nanoparticle compositions. Moreover, more than one mammalian cell may be contacted by a nanoparticle composition.
[0263]
As used herein, the term “delivering” means providing an entity to a destination. For example, delivering a therapeutic and/or prophylactic to a subject may involve administering a nanoparticle composition including the therapeutic and/or prophylactic to the subject (e.g., by an intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, or subcutaneous route). Administration of a nanoparticle composition to a mammal or mammalian cell may involve contacting one or more cells with the nanoparticle composition.
[0264]
As used herein, the term “enhanced delivery” means delivery of more (e.g., at least 1.5 fold more, at least 2-fold more, at least 3-fold more, at least 4-fold more, at least 5-fold more, at least 6-fold more, at least 7-fold more, at least 8-fold more, at least 9-fold more, at least 10-fold more) of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic by a nanoparticle to a target tissue of interest (e.g., mammalian liver) compared to the level of delivery of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic by a control nanoparticle to a target tissue of interest (e.g., MC3, KC2, or DLinDMA). The level of delivery of a nanoparticle to a particular tissue may be measured by comparing the amount of protein produced in a tissue to the weight of said tissue, comparing the amount of therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a tissue to the weight of said tissue, comparing the amount of protein produced in a tissue to the amount of total protein in said tissue, or comparing the amount of therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a tissue to the amount of total therapeutic and/or prophylactic in said tissue. It will be understood that the enhanced delivery of a nanoparticle to a target tissue need not be determined in a subject being treated, it may be determined in a surrogate such as an animal model (e.g., a rat model). In certain embodiments, a nanoparticle composition including a compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) has substantively the same level of delivery enhancement regardless of administration routes. For example, certain compounds disclosed herein exhibit similar delivery enhancement when they are used for delivering a therapeutic and/or prophylactic either intravenously or intramuscularly. In other embodiments, certain compounds disclosed herein (e.g., a compound of Formula (IA) or (II), such as Compound 18, 25, 30, 60, 108-112, or 122) exhibit a higher level of delivery enhancement when they are used for delivering a therapeutic and/or prophylactic intramuscularly than intravenously.

As used herein, the term “specific delivery,” “specifically deliver,” or “specifically delivering” means delivery of more (e.g., at least 1.5 fold more, at least 2-fold more, at least 3-fold more, at least 4-fold more, at least 5-fold more, at least 6-fold more, at least 7-fold more, at least 8-fold more, at least 9-fold more, at least 10-fold more) of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic by a nanoparticle to a target tissue of interest (e.g., mammalian liver) compared to an off-target tissue (e.g., mammalian spleen). The level of delivery of a nanoparticle to a particular tissue may be measured by comparing the amount of protein produced in a tissue to the weight of said tissue, comparing the amount of therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a tissue to the weight of said tissue, comparing the amount of protein produced in a tissue to the amount of total protein in said tissue, or comparing the amount of therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a tissue to the amount of total therapeutic and/or prophylactic in said tissue. For example, for renovascular targeting, a therapeutic and/or prophylactic is specifically provided to a mammalian kidney as compared to the liver and spleen if 1.5, 2-fold, 3-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15 fold, or 20 fold more therapeutic and/or prophylactic per 1 g of tissue is delivered to a kidney compared to that delivered to the liver or spleen following systemic administration of the therapeutic and/or prophylactic. It will be understood that the ability of a nanoparticle to specifically deliver to a target tissue need not be determined in a subject being treated, it may be determined in a surrogate such as an animal model (e.g., a rat model).
[0266]
As used herein, “encapsulation efficiency” refers to the amount of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic that becomes part of a nanoparticle composition, relative to the initial total amount of therapeutic and/or prophylactic used in the preparation of a nanoparticle composition.

In certain embodiments, the RNA is an mRNA.
[0316]
In certain embodiments, a therapeutic and/or prophylactic is an mRNA. An mRNA may encode any polypeptide of interest, including any naturally or non-naturally occurring or otherwise modified polypeptide. A polypeptide encoded by an mRNA may be of any size and may have any secondary structure or activity. In some embodiments, a polypeptide encoded by an mRNA may have a therapeutic effect when expressed in a cell.
[0317]
In other embodiments, a therapeutic and/or prophylactic is an siRNA. An siRNA may be capable of selectively knocking down or down regulating expression of a gene of interest. For example, an siRNA could be selected to silence a gene associated with a particular disease, disorder, or condition upon administration to a subject in need thereof of a nanoparticle composition including the siRNA. An siRNA may comprise a sequence that is complementary to an mRNA sequence that encodes a gene or protein of interest. In some embodiments, the siRNA may be an immunomodulatory siRNA.
[0318]
In some embodiments, a therapeutic and/or prophylactic is an shRNA or a vector or plasmid encoding the same. An shRNA may be produced inside a target cell upon delivery of an appropriate construct to the nucleus. Constructs and mechanisms relating to shRNA are well known in the relevant arts.
[0319]
Nucleic acids and polynucleotides useful in the disclosure typically include a first region of linked nucleosides encoding a polypeptide of interest (e.g., a coding region), a first flanking region located at the 5′-terminus of the first region (e.g., a 5′-UTR), a second flanking region located at the 3′-terminus of the first region (e.g., a 3′-UTR), at least one 5′-cap region, and a 3′-stabilizing region. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid or polynucleotide further includes a poly-A region or a Kozak sequence (e.g., in the 5′-UTR). In some cases, polynucleotides may contain one or more intronic nucleotide sequences capable of being excised from the polynucleotide. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide or nucleic acid (e.g., an mRNA) may include a 5′ cap structure, a chain terminating nucleotide, a stem loop, a polyA sequence, and/or a polyadenylation signal. Any one of the regions of a nucleic acid may include one or more alternative components (e.g., an alternative nucleoside).

In one embodiment, all or substantially all of the nucleotides comprising (a) the 5′-UTR, (b) the open reading frame (ORF), (c) the 3′-UTR, (d) the poly A tail, and any combination of (a, b, c, or d above) comprise naturally occurring canonical nucleotides A (adenosine), G (guanosine), C (cytosine), U (uridine), or T (thymidine).
[0324]
Nucleic acids and polynucleotides may include one or more alternative components, as described herein, which impart useful properties including increased stability and/or the lack of a substantial induction of the innate immune response of a cell into which the polynucleotide is introduced. For example, an alternative polynucleotide or nucleic acid exhibits reduced degradation in a cell into which the polynucleotide or nucleic acid is introduced, relative to a corresponding unaltered polynucleotide or nucleic acid. These alternative species may enhance the efficiency of protein production, intracellular retention of the polynucleotides, and/or viability of contacted cells, as well as possess reduced immunogenicity.
[0325]
Polynucleotides and nucleic acids may be naturally or non-naturally occurring. Polynucleotides and nucleic acids may include one or more modified (e.g., altered or alternative) nucleobases, nucleosides, nucleotides, or combinations thereof. The nucleic acids and polynucleotides useful in a nanoparticle composition can include any useful modification or alteration, such as to the nucleobase, the sugar, or the internucleoside linkage (e.g., to a linking phosphate/to a phosphodiester linkage/to the phosphodiester backbone). In certain embodiments, alterations (e.g., one or more alterations) are present in each of the nucleobase, the sugar, and the internucleoside linkage. Alterations according to the present disclosure may be alterations of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) to deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), e.g., the substitution of the 2′-OH of the ribofuranosyl ring to 2′-H, threose nucleic acids (TNAs), glycol nucleic acids (GNAs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), locked nucleic acids (LNAs), or hybrids thereof. Additional alterations are described herein.
[0326]
Polynucleotides and nucleic acids may or may not be uniformly altered along the entire length of the molecule. For example, one or more or all types of nucleotide (e.g., purine or pyrimidine, or any one or more or all of A, G, U, C) may or may not be uniformly altered in a polynucleotide or nucleic acid, or in a given predetermined sequence region thereof. In some instances, all nucleotides X in a polynucleotide (or in a given sequence region thereof) are altered, wherein X may any one of nucleotides A, G, U, C, or any one of the combinations A+G, A+U, A+C, G+U, G+C, U+C, A+G+U, A+G+C, G+U+C or A+G+C.
[0327]
Different sugar alterations and/or internucleoside linkages (e.g., backbone structures) may exist at various positions in a polynucleotide. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the nucleotide analogs or other alteration(s) may be located at any position(s) of a polynucleotide such that the function of the polynucleotide is not substantially decreased. An alteration may also be a 5′- or 3′-terminal alteration. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide includes an alteration at the 3′-terminus. The polynucleotide may contain from about 1% to about 100% alternative nucleotides (either in relation to overall nucleotide content, or in relation to one or more types of nucleotide, i.e., any one or more of A, G, U or C) or any intervening percentage (e.g., from 1% to 20%, from 1% to 25%, from 1% to 50%, from 1% to 60%, from 1% to 70%, from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 90%, from 1% to 95%, from 10% to 20%, from 10% to 25%, from 10% to 50%, from 10% to 60%, from 10% to 70%, from 10% to 80%, from 10% to 90%, from 10% to 95%, from 10% to 100%, from 20% to 25%, from 20% to 50%, from 20% to 60%, from 20% to 70%, from 20% to 80%, from 20% to 90%, from 20% to 95%, from 20% to 100%, from 50% to 60%, from 50% to 70%, from 50% to 80%, from 50% to 90%, from 50% to 95%, from 50% to 100%, from 70% to 80%, from 70% to 90%, from 70% to 95%, from 70% to 100%, from 80% to 90%, from 80% to 95%, from 80% to 100%, from 90% to 95%, from 90% to 100%, and from 95% to 100%). It will be understood that any remaining percentage is accounted for by the presence of a canonical nucleotide (e.g., A, G, U, or C).
[0328]
Polynucleotides may contain at a minimum zero and at maximum 100% alternative nucleotides, or any intervening percentage, such as at least 5% alternative nucleotides, at least 10% alternative nucleotides, at least 25% alternative nucleotides, at least 50% alternative nucleotides, at least 80% alternative nucleotides, or at least 90% alternative nucleotides. For example, polynucleotides may contain an alternative pyrimidine such as an alternative uracil or cytosine. In some embodiments, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 80%, at least 90% or 100% of the uracil in a polynucleotide is replaced with an alternative uracil (e.g., a 5-substituted uracil). The alternative uracil can be replaced by a compound having a single unique structure, or can be replaced by a plurality of compounds having different structures (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more unique structures). In some instances, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 80%, at least 90% or 100% of the cytosine in the polynucleotide is replaced with an alternative cytosine (e.g., a 5-substituted cytosine). The alternative cytosine can be replaced by a compound having a single unique structure, or can be replaced by a plurality of compounds having different structures (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more unique structures).
[0329]
In some instances, nucleic acids do not substantially induce an innate immune response of a cell into which the polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) is introduced. Features of an induced innate immune response include 1) increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 2) activation of intracellular PRRs (RIG-I, MDA5, etc., and/or 3) termination or reduction in protein translation.
[0330]
The nucleic acids can optionally include other agents (e.g., RNAi-inducing agents, RNAi agents, siRNAs, shRNAs, miRNAs, antisense RNAs, ribozymes, catalytic DNA, tRNA, RNAs that induce triple helix formation, aptamers, vectors). In some embodiments, the nucleic acids may include one or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs) having one or more alternative nucleoside or nucleotides (i.e., alternative mRNA molecules).
[0331]
In some embodiments, a nucleic acid (e.g. mRNA) molecule, formula, composition or method associated therewith comprises one or more polynucleotides comprising features as described in WO2002/098443, WO2003/051401, WO2008/052770, WO2009127230, WO2006122828, WO2008/083949, WO2010088927, WO2010/037539, WO2004/004743, WO2005/016376, WO2006/024518, WO2007/095976, WO2008/014979, WO2008/077592, WO2009/030481, WO2009/095226, WO2011069586, WO2011026641, WO2011/144358, WO2012019780, WO2012013326, WO2012089338, WO2012113513, WO2012116811, WO2012116810, WO2013113502, WO2013113501, WO2013113736, WO2013143698, WO2013143699, WO2013143700, WO2013/120626, WO2013120627, WO2013120628, WO2013120629, WO2013174409, WO2014127917, WO2015/024669, WO2015/024668, WO2015/024667, WO2015/024665, WO2015/024666, WO2015/024664, WO2015101415, WO2015101414, WO2015024667, WO2015062738, WO2015101416, all of which are incorporated by reference herein.
Nucleobase Alternatives
[0332]
The alternative nucleosides and nucleotides can include an alternative nucleobase. A nucleobase of a nucleic acid is an organic base such as a purine or pyrimidine or a derivative thereof. A nucleobase may be a canonical base (e.g., adenine, guanine, uracil, thymine, and cytosine). These nucleobases can be altered or wholly replaced to provide polynucleotide molecules having enhanced properties, e.g., increased stability such as resistance to nucleases. Non-canonical or modified bases may include, for example, one or more substitutions or modifications including but not limited to alkyl, aryl, halo, oxo, hydroxyl, alkyloxy, and/or thio substitutions; one or more fused or open rings; oxidation; and/or reduction.
[0333]
Alternative nucleotide base pairing encompasses not only the standard adenine-thymine, adenine-uracil, or guanine-cytosine base pairs, but also base pairs formed between nucleotides and/or alternative nucleotides including non-standard or alternative bases, wherein the arrangement of hydrogen bond donors and hydrogen bond acceptors permits hydrogen bonding between a non-standard base and a standard base or between two complementary non-standard base structures. One example of such non-standard base pairing is the base pairing between the alternative nucleotide inosine and adenine, cytosine, or uracil.

[0338]
The alternative nucleobase of a nucleotide can be independently a purine, a pyrimidine, a purine or pyrimidine analog. For example, the nucleobase can be an alternative to adenine, cytosine, guanine, uracil, or hypoxanthine. In another embodiment, the nucleobase can also include, for example, naturally-occurring and synthetic derivatives of a base, including pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines, 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C), 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2-thiocytosine, 5-propynyl uracil and cytosine, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 8-halo (e.g., 8-bromo), 8-amino, 8-thiol, 8-thioalkyl, 8-hydroxy and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 8-azaguanine and 8-azaadenine, deazaguanine, 7-deazaguanine, 3-deazaguanine, deazaadenine, 7-deazaadenine, 3-deazaadenine, pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, imidazo[1,5-a]1,3,5 triazinones, 9-deazapurines, imidazo[4,5-d]pyrazines, thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidines, pyrazin-2-ones, 1,2,4-triazine, pyridazine; or 1,3,5 triazine. When the nucleotides are depicted using the shorthand A, G, C, T or U, each letter refers to the representative base and/or derivatives thereof, e.g., A includes adenine or adenine analogs, e.g., 7-deaza adenine).
Alterations on the Sugar
[0339]
Nucleosides include a sugar molecule (e.g., a 5-carbon or 6-carbon sugar, such as pentose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, glucose, galactose, or a deoxy derivative thereof) in combination with a nucleobase, while nucleotides are nucleosides containing a nucleoside and a phosphate group or alternative group (e.g., boranophosphate, thiophosphate, selenophosphate, phosphonate, alkyl group, amidate, and glycerol). A nucleoside or nucleotide may be a canonical species, e.g., a nucleoside or nucleotide including a canonical nucleobase, sugar, and, in the case of nucleotides, a phosphate group, or may be an alternative nucleoside or nucleotide including one or more alternative components. For example, alternative nucleosides and nucleotides can be altered on the sugar of the nucleoside or nucleotide. In some embodiments, the alternative nucleosides or nucleotides include the structure:
In each of the Formulae IV, V, VI and VII,

[0343]
each of Y1, Y2, and Y3, is, independently, O, S, Se, —NRN1—, optionally substituted alkylene, or optionally substituted heteroalkylene, wherein RN1 is H, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl, optionally substituted aryl, or absent; each Y4 is, independently, H, hydroxy, thiol, boranyl, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl, optionally substituted alkoxy, optionally substituted alkenyloxy, optionally substituted alkynyloxy, optionally substituted thioalkoxy, optionally substituted alkoxyalkoxy, or optionally substituted amino;
[0344]
each Y5 is, independently, O, S, Se, optionally substituted alkylene (e.g., methylene), or optionally substituted heteroalkylene; and
[0345]
B is a nucleobase, either modified or unmodified. In some embodiments, the 2′-hydroxy group (OH) can be modified or replaced with a number of different substituents. Exemplary substitutions at the 2′-position include, but are not limited to, H, azido, halo (e.g., fluoro), optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl (e.g., methyl); optionally substituted C1-6 alkoxy (e.g., methoxy or ethoxy); optionally substituted C6-10 aryloxy; optionally substituted C3-8 cycloalkyl; optionally substituted C6-10 aryl-C1-6 alkoxy, optionally substituted C1-12 (heterocyclyl)oxy; a sugar (e.g., ribose, pentose, or any described herein); a polyethyleneglycol (PEG), —O(CH2CH2O)nCH2CH2OR, where R is H or optionally substituted alkyl, and n is an integer from 0 to 20 (e.g., from 0 to 4, from 0 to 8, from 0 to 10, from 0 to 16, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 8, from 1 to 10, from 1 to 16, from 1 to 20, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 8, from 2 to 10, from 2 to 16, from 2 to 20, from 4 to 8, from 4 to 10, from 4 to 16, and from 4 to 20); “locked” nucleic acids (LNA) in which the 2′-hydroxy is connected by a C1-6 alkylene or C1-6 heteroalkylene bridge to the 4′-carbon of the same ribose sugar, where exemplary bridges included methylene, propylene, ether, or amino bridges; aminoalkyl, as defined herein; aminoalkoxy, as defined herein; amino as defined herein; and amino acid, as defined herein.
[0346]
Generally, RNA includes the sugar group ribose, which is a 5-membered ring having an oxygen. Exemplary, non-limiting alternative nucleotides include replacement of the oxygen in ribose (e.g., with S, Se, or alkylene, such as methylene or ethylene); addition of a double bond (e.g., to replace ribose with cyclopentenyl or cyclohexenyl); ring contraction of ribose (e.g., to form a 4-membered ring of cyclobutane or oxetane); ring expansion of ribose (e.g., to form a 6- or 7-membered ring having an additional carbon or heteroatom, such as for anhydrohexitol, altritol, mannitol, cyclohexanyl, cyclohexenyl, and morpholino (that also has a phosphoramidate backbone)); multicyclic forms (e.g., tricyclo and “unlocked” forms, such as glycol nucleic acid (GNA) (e.g., R-GNA or S-GNA, where ribose is replaced by glycol units attached to phosphodiester bonds), threose nucleic acid (TNA, where ribose is replace with α-L-threofuranosyl-(3′→2′)), and peptide nucleic acid (PNA, where 2-amino-ethyl-glycine linkages replace the ribose and phosphodiester backbone).
[0347]
In some embodiments, the sugar group contains one or more carbons that possess the opposite stereochemical configuration of the corresponding carbon in ribose. Thus, a polynucleotide molecule can include nucleotides containing, e.g., arabinose or L-ribose, as the sugar.
[0348]
In some embodiments, the polynucleotide includes at least one nucleoside wherein the sugar is L-ribose, 2′-O-methyl-ribose, 2′-fluoro-ribose, arabinose, hexitol, an LNA, or a PNA.
Alterations on the Internucleoside Linkage
[0349]
Alternative nucleotides can be altered on the internucleoside linkage (e.g., phosphate backbone). Herein, in the context of the polynucleotide backbone, the phrases “phosphate” and “phosphodiester” are used interchangeably. Backbone phosphate groups can be altered by replacing one or more of the oxygen atoms with a different substituent.
[0350]
The alternative nucleotides can include the wholesale replacement of an unaltered phosphate moiety with another internucleoside linkage as described herein. Examples of alternative phosphate groups include, but are not limited to, phosphorothioate, phosphoroselenates, boranophosphates, boranophosphate esters, hydrogen phosphonates, phosphoramidates, phosphorodiamidates, alkyl or aryl phosphonates, and phosphotriesters. Phosphorodithioates have both non-linking oxygens replaced by sulfur. The phosphate linker can also be altered by the replacement of a linking oxygen with nitrogen (bridged phosphoramidates), sulfur (bridged phosphorothioates), and carbon (bridged methylene-phosphonates).
[0351]
The alternative nucleosides and nucleotides can include the replacement of one or more of the non-bridging oxygens with a borane moiety (BH3), sulfur (thio), methyl, ethyl, and/or methoxy. As a non-limiting example, two non-bridging oxygens at the same position (e.g., the alpha (α), beta (β) or gamma (γ) position) can be replaced with a sulfur (thio) and a methoxy.
[0352]
The replacement of one or more of the oxygen atoms at the a position of the phosphate moiety (e.g., α-thio phosphate) is provided to confer stability (such as against exonucleases and endonucleases) to RNA and DNA through the unnatural phosphorothioate backbone linkages. Phosphorothioate DNA and RNA have increased nuclease resistance and subsequently a longer half-life in a cellular environment.
[0353]
Other internucleoside linkages that may be employed according to the present disclosure, including internucleoside linkages which do not contain a phosphorous atom, are described herein.
Internal Ribosome Entry Sites
[0354]
Polynucleotides may contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). An IRES may act as the sole ribosome binding site, or may serve as one of multiple ribosome binding sites of an mRNA. A polynucleotide containing more than one functional ribosome binding site may encode several peptides or polypeptides that are translated independently by the ribosomes (e.g., multicistronic mRNA). When polynucleotides are provided with an IRES, further optionally provided is a second translatable region. Examples of IRES sequences that can be used according to the present disclosure include without limitation, those from picornaviruses (e.g., FMDV), pest viruses (CFFV), polio viruses (PV), encephalomyocarditis viruses (ECMV), foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDV), hepatitis C viruses (HCV), classical swine fever viruses (CSFV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), simian immune deficiency viruses (SIV) or cricket paralysis viruses (CrPV).
5′-Cap Structure
[0355]
A polynucleotide (e.g., an mRNA) may include a 5′-cap structure. The 5′-cap structure of a polynucleotide is involved in nuclear export and increasing polynucleotide stability and binds the mRNA Cap Binding Protein (CBP), which is responsible for polynucleotide stability in the cell and translation competency through the association of CBP with poly-A binding protein to form the mature cyclic mRNA species. The cap further assists the removal of 5′-proximal introns removal during mRNA splicing.
[0356]
Endogenous polynucleotide molecules may be 5′-end capped generating a 5′-ppp-5′-triphosphate linkage between a terminal guanosine cap residue and the 5′-terminal transcribed sense nucleotide of the polynucleotide. This 5′-guanylate cap may then be methylated to generate an N7-methyl-guanylate residue. The ribose sugars of the terminal and/or anteterminal transcribed nucleotides of the 5′ end of the polynucleotide may optionally also be 2′-O-methylated. 5′-decapping through hydrolysis and cleavage of the guanylate cap structure may target a polynucleotide molecule, such as an mRNA molecule, for degradation.
[0357]
Alterations to polynucleotides may generate a non-hydrolyzable cap structure preventing decapping and thus increasing polynucleotide half-life. Because cap structure hydrolysis requires cleavage of 5′-ppp-5′ phosphorodiester linkages, alternative nucleotides may be used during the capping reaction. For example, a Vaccinia Capping Enzyme from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, Mass.) may be used with α-thio-guanosine nucleotides according to the manufacturer's instructions to create a phosphorothioate linkage in the 5′-ppp-5′ cap. Additional alternative guanosine nucleotides may be used such as α-methyl-phosphonate and seleno-phosphate nucleotides.
[0358]
Additional alterations include, but are not limited to, 2′-O-methylation of the ribose sugars of 5′-terminal and/or 5′-anteterminal nucleotides of the polynucleotide (as mentioned above) on the 2′-hydroxy group of the sugar. Multiple distinct 5′-cap structures can be used to generate the 5′-cap of a polynucleotide, such as an mRNA molecule.
[0359]
5′-Cap structures include those described in International Patent Publication Nos. WO2008127688, WO 2008016473, and WO 2011015347, the cap structures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0360]
Cap analogs, which herein are also referred to as synthetic cap analogs, chemical caps, chemical cap analogs, or structural or functional cap analogs, differ from natural (i.e., endogenous, wild-type, or physiological) 5′-caps in their chemical structure, while retaining cap function. Cap analogs may be chemically (i.e., non-enzymatically) or enzymatically synthesized and/linked to a polynucleotide.
[0361]
For example, the Anti-Reverse Cap Analog (ARCA) cap contains two guanosines linked by a 5′-5′-triphosphate group, wherein one guanosine contains an N7-methyl group as well as a 3′-O-methyl group (i.e., N7,3′-O-dimethyl-guanosine-5′-triphosphate-5′-guanosine, m7G-3′mppp-G, which may equivalently be designated 3′ O-Me-m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G). The 3′-O atom of the other, unaltered, guanosine becomes linked to the 5′-terminal nucleotide of the capped polynucleotide (e.g., an mRNA). The N7- and 3′-O-methlyated guanosine provides the terminal moiety of the capped polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA).
[0362]
Another exemplary cap is mCAP, which is similar to ARCA but has a 2′-O-methyl group on guanosine (i.e., N7,2′-O-dimethyl-guanosine-5′-triphosphate-5′-guanosine, m7Gm-ppp-G).
[0363]
A cap may be a dinucleotide cap analog. As a non-limiting example, the dinucleotide cap analog may be modified at different phosphate positions with a boranophosphate group or a phophoroselenoate group such as the dinucleotide cap analogs described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,519,110, the cap structures of which are herein incorporated by reference.
[0364]
Alternatively, a cap analog may be a N7-(4-chlorophenoxyethyl) substituted dinucleotide cap analog known in the art and/or described herein. Non-limiting examples of N7-(4-chlorophenoxyethyl) substituted dinucleotide cap analogs include a N7-(4-chlorophenoxyethyl)-G(5′)ppp(5′)G and a N7-(4-chlorophenoxyethyl)-m3′-OG(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analog (see, e.g., the various cap analogs and the methods of synthesizing cap analogs described in Kore et al. Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 2013 21:4570-4574; the cap structures of which are herein incorporated by reference). In other instances, a cap analog useful in the polynucleotides of the present disclosure is a 4-chloro/bromophenoxyethyl analog.
[0365]
While cap analogs allow for the concomitant capping of a polynucleotide in an in vitro transcription reaction, up to 20% of transcripts remain uncapped. This, as well as the structural differences of a cap analog from endogenous 5′-cap structures of polynucleotides produced by the endogenous, cellular transcription machinery, may lead to reduced translational competency and reduced cellular stability.
[0366]
Alternative polynucleotides may also be capped post-transcriptionally, using enzymes, in order to generate more authentic 5′-cap structures. As used herein, the phrase “more authentic” refers to a feature that closely mirrors or mimics, either structurally or functionally, an endogenous or wild type feature. That is, a “more authentic” feature is better representative of an endogenous, wild-type, natural or physiological cellular function, and/or structure as compared to synthetic features or analogs of the prior art, or which outperforms the corresponding endogenous, wild-type, natural, or physiological feature in one or more respects. Non-limiting examples of more authentic 5′-cap structures useful in the polynucleotides of the present disclosure are those which, among other things, have enhanced binding of cap binding proteins, increased half life, reduced susceptibility to 5′-endonucleases, and/or reduced 5′-decapping, as compared to synthetic 5′-cap structures known in the art (or to a wild-type, natural or physiological 5′-cap structure). For example, recombinant Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme and recombinant 2′-O-methyltransferase enzyme can create a canonical 5′-5′-triphosphate linkage between the 5′-terminal nucleotide of a polynucleotide and a guanosine cap nucleotide wherein the cap guanosine contains an N7-methylation and the 5′-terminal nucleotide of the polynucleotide contains a 2′-O-methyl. Such a structure is termed the Cap1 structure. This cap results in a higher translational-competency, cellular stability, and a reduced activation of cellular pro-inflammatory cytokines, as compared, e.g., to other 5′cap analog structures known in the art. Other exemplary cap structures include 7mG(5′)ppp(5′)N,pN2p (Cap 0), 7mG(5′)ppp(5′)NlmpNp (Cap 1), 7mG(5′)-ppp(5′)NlmpN2mp (Cap 2), and m(7)Gpppm(3)(6,6,2′)Apm(2′)Apm(2′)Cpm(2)(3,2′)Up (Cap 4).
[0367]
Because the alternative polynucleotides may be capped post-transcriptionally, and because this process is more efficient, nearly 100% of the alternative polynucleotides may be capped. This is in contrast to ˜80% when a cap analog is linked to an polynucleotide in the course of an in vitro transcription reaction.
[0368]
5′-terminal caps may include endogenous caps or cap analogs. A 5′-terminal cap may include a guanosine analog. Useful guanosine analogs include inosine, N1-methyl-guanosine, 2′-fluoro-guanosine, 7-deaza-guanosine, 8-oxo-guanosine, 2-amino-guanosine, LNA-guanosine, and 2-azido-guanosine.
[0369]
In some cases, a polynucleotide contains a modified 5′-cap. A modification on the 5′-cap may increase the stability of polynucleotide, increase the half-life of the polynucleotide, and could increase the polynucleotide translational efficiency. The modified 5′-cap may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following modifications: modification at the 2′- and/or 3′-position of a capped guanosine triphosphate (GTP), a replacement of the sugar ring oxygen (that produced the carbocyclic ring) with a methylene moiety (CH2), a modification at the triphosphate bridge moiety of the cap structure, or a modification at the nucleobase (G) moiety.
5′-UTRs
[0370]
A 5′-UTR may be provided as a flanking region to polynucleotides (e.g., mRNAs). A 5′-UTR may be homologous or heterologous to the coding region found in a polynucleotide. Multiple 5′-UTRs may be included in the flanking region and may be the same or of different sequences. Any portion of the flanking regions, including none, may be codon optimized and any may independently contain one or more different structural or chemical alterations, before and/or after codon optimization.
[0371]
Shown in Table 21 in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/775,509, and in Table 21 and in Table 22 in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/829,372, of which are incorporated herein by reference, is a listing of the start and stop site of alternative polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA). In Table 21 each 5′-UTR (5′-UTR-005 to 5′-UTR 68511) is identified by its start and stop site relative to its native or wild type (homologous) transcript (ENST; the identifier used in the ENSEMBL database).
[0372]
To alter one or more properties of a polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA), 5′-UTRs which are heterologous to the coding region of an alternative polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) may be engineered. The polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) may then be administered to cells, tissue or organisms and outcomes such as protein level, localization, and/or half-life may be measured to evaluate the beneficial effects the heterologous 5′-UTR may have on the alternative polynucleotides (mRNA). Variants of the 5′-UTRs may be utilized wherein one or more nucleotides are added or removed to the termini, including A, T, C or G. 5′-UTRs may also be codon-optimized, or altered in any manner described herein.
5′-UTRs, 3′-UTRs, and Translation Enhancer Elements (TEEs)
[0373]
The 5′-UTR of a polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) may include at least one translation enhancer element. The term “translational enhancer element” refers to sequences that increase the amount of polypeptide or protein produced from a polynucleotide. As a non-limiting example, the TEE may be located between the transcription promoter and the start codon. The polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) with at least one TEE in the 5′-UTR may include a cap at the 5′-UTR. Further, at least one TEE may be located in the 5′-UTR of polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) undergoing cap-dependent or cap-independent translation.
[0374]
In one aspect, TEEs are conserved elements in the UTR which can promote translational activity of a polynucleotide such as, but not limited to, cap-dependent or cap-independent translation. The conservation of these sequences has been previously shown by Panek et al. (Nucleic Acids Research, 2013, 1-10) across 14 species including humans.
[0375]
In one non-limiting example, the TEEs known may be in the 5′-leader of the Gtx homeodomain protein (Chappell et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:9590-9594, 2004, the TEEs of which are incorporated herein by reference).
[0376]
In another non-limiting example, TEEs are disclosed as SEQ ID NOs: 1-35 in US Patent Publication No. 2009/0226470, SEQ ID NOs: 1-35 in US Patent Publication No. 2013/0177581, SEQ ID NOs: 1-35 in International Patent Publication No. WO2009/075886, SEQ ID NOs: 1-5, and 7-645 in International Patent Publication No. WO2012/009644, SEQ ID NO: 1 in International Patent Publication No. WO1999/024595, SEQ ID NO: 1 in U.S. Pat. No. 6,310,197, and SEQ ID NO: 1 in U.S. Pat. No. 6,849,405, the TEE sequences of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0377]
In yet another non-limiting example, the TEE may be an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), HCV-IRES or an IRES element such as, but not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,468,275, US Patent Publication Nos. 2007/0048776 and 2011/0124100 and International Patent Publication Nos. WO2007/025008 and WO2001/055369, the IRES sequences of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. The IRES elements may include, but are not limited to, the Gtx sequences (e.g., Gtx9-nt, Gtx8-nt, Gtx7-nt) described by Chappell et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:9590-9594, 2004) and Zhou et al. (PNAS 102:6273-6278, 2005) and in US Patent Publication Nos. 2007/0048776 and 2011/0124100 and International Patent Publication No. WO2007/025008, the IRES sequences of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0378]
“Translational enhancer polynucleotides” are polynucleotides which include one or more of the specific TEE exemplified herein and/or disclosed in the art (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,310,197, 6,849,405, 7,456,273, 7,183,395, U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20090/226470, 2007/0048776, 2011/0124100, 2009/0093049, 2013/0177581, International Patent Publication Nos. WO2009/075886, WO2007/025008, WO2012/009644, WO2001/055371 WO1999/024595, and European Patent Nos. 2610341 and 2610340; the TEE sequences of each of which are incorporated herein by reference) or their variants, homologs or functional derivatives. One or multiple copies of a specific TEE can be present in a polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA). The TEEs in the translational enhancer polynucleotides can be organized in one or more sequence segments. A sequence segment can harbor one or more of the specific TEEs exemplified herein, with each TEE being present in one or more copies. When multiple sequence segments are present in a translational enhancer polynucleotide, they can be homogenous or heterogeneous. Thus, the multiple sequence segments in a translational enhancer polynucleotide can harbor identical or different types of the specific TEEs exemplified herein, identical or different number of copies of each of the specific TEEs, and/or identical or different organization of the TEEs within each sequence segment.
[0379]
A polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) may include at least one TEE that is described in International Patent Publication Nos. WO1999/024595, WO2012/009644, WO2009/075886, WO2007/025008, WO1999/024595, European Patent Publication Nos. 2610341 and 2610340, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,310,197, 6,849,405, 7,456,273, 7,183,395, and US Patent Publication Nos. 2009/0226470, 2011/0124100, 2007/0048776, 2009/0093049, and 2013/0177581 the TEE sequences of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The TEE sequences in the 3′-UTR of the polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) of the present disclosure may be the same or different TEE sequences. The TEE sequences may be in a pattern such as ABABAB, AABBAABBAABB, or ABCABCABC, or variants thereof, repeated once, twice, or more than three times. In these patterns, each letter, A, B, or C represent a different TEE sequence at the nucleotide level.
[0393]
In one instance, the 3′-UTR may include a spacer to separate two TEE sequences. As a non-limiting example, the spacer may be a 15 nucleotide spacer and/or other spacers known in the art.

[0395]

A Pumilio-induced RNA structure switch in p27-3′UTR controls miR-221 and miR-22 accessibility. Nature Cell Biology. 2010).
Stem Loops
[0396]
Polynucleotides (e.g., mRNAs) may include a stem loop such as, but not limited to, a histone stem loop. The stem loop may be a nucleotide sequence that is about 25 or about 26 nucleotides in length such as, but not limited to, SEQ ID NOs: 7-17 as described in International Patent Publication No. WO2013/103659, of which SEQ ID NOs: 7-17 are incorporated herein by reference. The histone stem loop may be located 3′-relative to the coding region (e.g., at the 3′-terminus of the coding region). As a non-limiting example, the stem loop may be located at the 3′-end of a polynucleotide described herein. In some cases, a polynucleotide (e.g., an mRNA) includes more than one stem loop (e.g., two stem loops). Examples of stem loop sequences are described in International Patent Publication Nos. WO2012/019780 and WO201502667, the stem loop sequences of which are herein incorporated by reference. In some instances, a polynucleotide includes the stem loop sequence CAAAGGCTCTTTTCAGAGCCACCA (SEQ ID NO: 5). In others, a polynucleotide includes the stem loop sequence CAAAGGCUCUUUUCAGAGCCACCA (SEQ ID NO: 6).
[0397]
A stem loop may be located in a second terminal region of a polynucleotide. As a non-limiting example, the stem loop may be located within an untranslated region (e.g., 3′-UTR) in a second terminal region.
[0398]
In some cases, a polynucleotide such as, but not limited to mRNA, which includes the histone stem loop may be stabilized by the addition of a 3′-stabilizing region (e.g., a 3′-stabilizing region including at least one chain terminating nucleoside). Not wishing to be bound by theory, the addition of at least one chain terminating nucleoside may slow the degradation of a polynucleotide and thus can increase the half-life of the polynucleotide.
[0399]
In other cases, a polynucleotide such as, but not limited to mRNA, which includes the histone stem loop may be stabilized by an alteration to the 3′-region of the polynucleotide that can prevent and/or inhibit the addition of oligio(U) (see e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO2013/103659).
[0400]
In yet other cases, a polynucleotide such as, but not limited to mRNA, which includes the histone stem loop may be stabilized by the addition of an oligonucleotide that terminates in a 3′-deoxynucleoside, 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside 3′-O-methylnucleosides, 3′-O-ethylnucleosides, 3′-arabinosides, and other alternative nucleosides known in the art and/or described herein.

[0404]
In certain instances, the conserved stem loop region may include a miR sequence described herein and may also include a TEE sequence.
[0405]
In some cases, the incorporation of a miR sequence and/or a TEE sequence changes the shape of the stem loop region which may increase and/or decrease translation. (See, e.g., Kedde et al. A Pumilio-induced RNA structure switch in p27-3′UTR controls miR-221 and miR-22 accessibility. Nature Cell Biology. 2010, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).
[0406]
Polynucleotides may include at least one histone stem-loop and a poly-A region or polyadenylation signal. Non-limiting examples of polynucleotide sequences encoding for at least one histone stem-loop and a poly-A region or a polyadenylation signal are described in International Patent Publication No. WO2013/120497, WO2013/120629, WO2013/120500, WO2013/120627, WO2013/120498, WO2013/120626, WO2013/120499 and WO2013/120628, the sequences of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. In certain cases, the polynucleotide encoding for a histone stem loop and a poly-A region or a polyadenylation signal may code for a pathogen antigen or fragment thereof such as the polynucleotide sequences described in International Patent Publication No WO2013/120499 and WO2013/120628, the sequences of both of which are incorporated herein by reference. In other cases, the polynucleotide encoding for a histone stem loop and a poly-A region or a polyadenylation signal may code for a therapeutic protein such as the polynucleotide sequences described in International Patent Publication No WO2013/120497 and WO2013/120629, the sequences of both of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some cases, the polynucleotide encoding for a histone stem loop and a poly-A region or a polyadenylation signal may code for a tumor antigen or fragment thereof such as the polynucleotide sequences described in International Patent Publication No WO2013/120500 and WO2013/120627, the sequences of both of which are incorporated herein by reference. In other cases, the polynucleotide encoding for a histone stem loop and a poly-A region or a polyadenylation signal may code for a allergenic antigen or an autoimmune self-antigen such as the polynucleotide sequences described in International Patent Publication No WO2013/120498 and WO2013/120626, the sequences of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Poly-A Regions
[0407]
A polynucleotide or nucleic acid (e.g., an mRNA) may include a polyA sequence and/or polyadenylation signal. A polyA sequence may be comprised entirely or mostly of adenine nucleotides or analogs or derivatives thereof. A polyA sequence may be a tail located adjacent to a 3′ untranslated region of a nucleic acid.
[0408]
During RNA processing, a long chain of adenosine nucleotides (poly-A region) is normally added to messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules to increase the stability of the molecule. Immediately after transcription, the 3′-end of the transcript is cleaved to free a 3′-hydroxy. Then poly-A polymerase adds a chain of adenosine nucleotides to the RNA. The process, called polyadenylation, adds a poly-A region that is between 100 and 250 residues long.
[0409]
Unique poly-A region lengths may provide certain advantages to the alternative polynucleotides of the present disclosure.
[0410]
Generally, the length of a poly-A region of the present disclosure is at least 30 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the poly-A region is at least 35 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the length is at least 40 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 45 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 55 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 60 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 70 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 80 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 90 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 100 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 120 nucleotides.

In another embodiment, the length is at least 2000 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 2500 nucleotides. In another embodiment, the length is at least 3000 nucleotides.
[0411]
In some instances, the poly-A region may be 80 nucleotides, 120 nucleotides, 160 nucleotides in length on an alternative polynucleotide molecule described herein.
[0412]
In other instances, the poly-A region may be 20, 40, 80, 100, 120, 140 or 160 nucleotides in length on an alternative polynucleotide molecule described herein.
[0413]
In some cases, the poly-A region is designed relative to the length of the overall alternative polynucleotide. This design may be based on the length of the coding region of the alternative polynucleotide, the length of a particular feature or region of the alternative polynucleotide (such as mRNA), or based on the length of the ultimate product expressed from the alternative polynucleotide. When relative to any feature of the alternative polynucleotide (e.g., other than the mRNA portion which includes the poly-A region) the poly-A region may be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% greater in length than the additional feature. The poly-A region may also be designed as a fraction of the alternative polynucleotide to which it belongs. In this context, the poly-A region may be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90% or more of the total length of the construct or the total length of the construct minus the poly-A region.
[0414]
In certain cases, engineered binding sites and/or the conjugation of polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) for poly-A binding protein may be used to enhance expression. The engineered binding sites may be sensor sequences which can operate as binding sites for ligands of the local microenvironment of the polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA). As a non-limiting example, the polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) may include at least one engineered binding site to alter the binding affinity of poly-A binding protein (PABP) and analogs thereof. The incorporation of at least one engineered binding site may increase the binding affinity of the PABP and analogs thereof.
[0415]
Additionally, multiple distinct polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) may be linked together to the PABP (poly-A binding protein) through the 3′-end using alternative nucleotides at the 3′-terminus of the poly-A region. Transfection experiments can be conducted in relevant cell lines at and protein production can be assayed by ELISA at 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and day 7 post-transfection. As a non-limiting example, the transfection experiments may be used to evaluate the effect on PABP or analogs thereof binding affinity as a result of the addition of at least one engineered binding site.
[0416]
In certain cases, a poly-A region may be used to modulate translation initiation. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the poly-A region recruits PABP which in turn can interact with translation initiation complex and thus may be essential for protein synthesis.
[0417]
In some cases, a poly-A region may also be used in the present disclosure to protect against 3′-5′-exonuclease digestion.
[0418]
In some instances, a polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) may include a polyA-G Quartet. The G-quartet is a cyclic hydrogen bonded array of four guanosine nucleotides that can be formed by G-rich sequences in both DNA and RNA. In this embodiment, the G-quartet is incorporated at the end of the poly-A region. The resultant polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) may be assayed for stability, protein production and other parameters including half-life at various time points. It has been discovered that the polyA-G quartet results in protein production equivalent to at least 75% of that seen using a poly-A region of 120 nucleotides alone.
[0419]
In some cases, a polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) may include a poly-A region and may be stabilized by the addition of a 3′-stabilizing region. The polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) with a poly-A region may further include a 5′-cap structure.
[0420]
In other cases, a polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) may include a poly-A-G Quartet. The polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) with a poly-A-G Quartet may further include a 5′-cap structure.
[0421]
In some cases, the 3′-stabilizing region which may be used to stabilize a polynucleotide (e.g., mRNA) including a poly-A region or poly-A-G Quartet may be, but is not limited to, those described in International Patent Publication No. WO2013/103659, the poly-A regions and poly-A-G Quartets of which are incorporated herein by reference. In other cases, the 3′-stabilizing region which may be used with the present disclosure include a chain termination nucleoside such as 3′-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3′-deoxyuridine, 3′-deoxycytosine, 3′-deoxyguanosine, 3′-deoxythymine, 2′,3′-dideoxynucleosides, such as 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine, 2′,3′-dideoxyuridine, 2′,3′-dideoxycytosine, 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine, 2′,3′-dideoxythymine, a 2′-deoxynucleoside, or an O-methylnucleoside.
[0422]
In other cases, a polynucleotide such as, but not limited to mRNA, which includes a polyA region or a poly-A-G Quartet may be stabilized by an alteration to the 3′-region of the polynucleotide that can prevent and/or inhibit the addition of oligio(U) (see e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO2013/103659).
[0423]
In yet other instances, a polynucleotide such as, but not limited to mRNA, which includes a poly-A region or a poly-A-G Quartet may be stabilized by the addition of an oligonucleotide that terminates in a 3′-deoxynucleoside, 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside 3′-O-methylnucleosides, 3′-O-ethylnucleosides, 3′-arabinosides, and other alternative nucleosides known in the art and/or described herein.

Such species may include 3′-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin), 3′-deoxyuridine, 3′-deoxycytosine, 3′-deoxyguanosine, 3′-deoxythymine, and 2′,3′-dideoxynucleosides, such as 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine, 2′,3′-dideoxyuridine, 2′,3′-dideoxycytosine, 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine, and 2′,3′-dideoxythymine.

Formulations
[0437]
Nanoparticle compositions may include a lipid component and one or more additional components, such as a therapeutic and/or prophylactic. A nanoparticle composition may be designed for one or more specific applications or targets. The elements of a nanoparticle composition may be selected based on a particular application or target, and/or based on the efficacy, toxicity, expense, ease of use, availability, or other feature of one or more elements. Similarly, the particular formulation of a nanoparticle composition may be selected for a particular application or target according to, for example, the efficacy and toxicity of particular combinations of elements.
[0438]
The lipid component of a nanoparticle composition may include, for example, a lipid according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe), a phospholipid (such as an unsaturated lipid, e.g., DOPE or DSPC), a PEG lipid, and a structural lipid. The elements of the lipid component may be provided in specific fractions.
[0439]
In some embodiments, the lipid component of a nanoparticle composition includes a lipid according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe), a phospholipid, a PEG lipid, and a structural lipid. In certain embodiments, the lipid component of the nanoparticle composition includes about 30 mol % to about 60 mol % compound of Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe), about 0 mol % to about 30 mol % phospholipid, about 18.5 mol % to about 48.5 mol % structural lipid, and about 0 mol % to about 10 mol % of PEG lipid, provided that the total mol % does not exceed 100%. In some embodiments, the lipid component of the nanoparticle composition includes about 35 mol % to about 55 mol % compound of Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe), about 5 mol % to about 25 mol % phospholipid, about 30 mol % to about 40 mol % structural lipid, and about 0 mol % to about 10 mol % of PEG lipid.

In some embodiments, the phospholipid may be DOPE or DSPC. In other embodiments, the PEG lipid may be PEG-DMG and/or the structural lipid may be cholesterol.
[0440]
Nanoparticle compositions may be designed for one or more specific applications or targets. For example, a nanoparticle composition may be designed to deliver a therapeutic and/or prophylactic such as an RNA to a particular cell, tissue, organ, or system or group thereof in a mammal's body. Physiochemical properties of nanoparticle compositions may be altered in order to increase selectivity for particular bodily targets. For instance, particle sizes may be adjusted based on the fenestration sizes of different organs. The therapeutic and/or prophylactic included in a nanoparticle composition may also be selected based on the desired delivery target or targets. For example, a therapeutic and/or prophylactic may be selected for a particular indication, condition, disease, or disorder and/or for delivery to a particular cell, tissue, organ, or system or group thereof (e.g., localized or specific delivery). In certain embodiments, a nanoparticle composition may include an mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest capable of being translated within a cell to produce the polypeptide of interest. Such a composition may be designed to be specifically delivered to a particular organ. In some embodiments, a composition may be designed to be specifically delivered to a mammalian liver.
[0441]
The amount of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a nanoparticle composition may depend on the size, composition, desired target and/or application, or other properties of the nanoparticle composition as well as on the properties of the therapeutic and/or prophylactic. For example, the amount of an RNA useful in a nanoparticle composition may depend on the size, sequence, and other characteristics of the RNA. The relative amounts of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic and other elements (e.g., lipids) in a nanoparticle composition may also vary. In some embodiments, the wt/wt ratio of the lipid component to a therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a nanoparticle composition may be from about 5:1 to about 60:1, such as 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1, 14:1, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, 18:1, 19:1, 20:1, 25:1, 30:1, 35:1, 40:1, 45:1, 50:1, and 60:1. For example, the wt/wt ratio of the lipid component to a therapeutic and/or prophylactic may be from about 10:1 to about 40:1. In certain embodiments, the wt/wt ratio is about 20:1. The amount of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a nanoparticle composition may, for example, be measured using absorption spectroscopy (e.g., ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy).
[0442]
In some embodiments, a nanoparticle composition includes one or more RNAs, and the one or more RNAs, lipids, and amounts thereof may be selected to provide a specific N:P ratio. The N:P ratio of the composition refers to the molar ratio of nitrogen atoms in one or more lipids to the number of phosphate groups in an RNA. In general, a lower N:P ratio is preferred. The one or more RNA, lipids, and amounts thereof may be selected to provide an N:P ratio from about 2:1 to about 30:1, such as 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 12:1, 14:1, 16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1, 24:1, 26:1, 28:1, or 30:1. In certain embodiments, the N:P ratio may be from about 2:1 to about 8:1. In other embodiments, the N:P ratio is from about 5:1 to about 8:1. For example, the N:P ratio may be about 5.0:1, about 5.5:1, about 5.67:1, about 6.0:1, about 6.5:1, or about 7.0:1. For example, the N:P ratio may be about 5.67:1.
Physical Properties
[0443]
The characteristics of a nanoparticle composition may depend on the components thereof. For example, a nanoparticle composition including cholesterol as a structural lipid may have different characteristics than a nanoparticle composition that includes a different structural lipid. Similarly, the characteristics of a nanoparticle composition may depend on the absolute or relative amounts of its components. For instance, a nanoparticle composition including a higher molar fraction of a phospholipid may have different characteristics than a nanoparticle composition including a lower molar fraction of a phospholipid. Characteristics may also vary depending on the method and conditions of preparation of the nanoparticle composition.
[0444]
Nanoparticle compositions may be characterized by a variety of methods. For example, microscopy (e.g., transmission electron microscopy or scanning electron microscopy) may be used to examine the morphology and size distribution of a nanoparticle composition. Dynamic light scattering or potentiometry (e.g., potentiometric titrations) may be used to measure zeta potentials. Dynamic light scattering may also be utilized to determine particle sizes. Instruments such as the Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) may also be used to measure multiple characteristics of a nanoparticle composition, such as particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential.
[0445]
The mean size of a nanoparticle composition may be between 10s of nm and 100s of nm, e.g., measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). For example, the mean size may be from about 40 nm to about 150 nm, such as about 40 nm, 45 nm, 50 nm, 55 nm, 60 nm, 65 nm, 70 nm, 75 nm, 80 nm, 85 nm, 90 nm, 95 nm, 100 nm, 105 nm, 110 nm, 115 nm, 120 nm, 125 nm, 130 nm, 135 nm, 140 nm, 145 nm, or 150 nm. In some embodiments, the mean size of a nanoparticle composition may be from about 50 nm to about 100 nm, from about 50 nm to about 90 nm, from about 50 nm to about 80 nm, from about 50 nm to about 70 nm, from about 50 nm to about 60 nm, from about 60 nm to about 100 nm, from about 60 nm to about 90 nm, from about 60 nm to about 80 nm, from about 60 nm to about 70 nm, from about 70 nm to about 100 nm, from about 70 nm to about 90 nm, from about 70 nm to about 80 nm, from about 80 nm to about 100 nm, from about 80 nm to about 90 nm, or from about 90 nm to about 100 nm. In certain embodiments, the mean size of a nanoparticle composition may be from about 70 nm to about 100 nm. In a particular embodiment, the mean size may be about 80 nm. In other embodiments, the mean size may be about 100 nm.
[0446]
A nanoparticle composition may be relatively homogenous. A polydispersity index may be used to indicate the homogeneity of a nanoparticle composition, e.g., the particle size distribution of the nanoparticle compositions. A small (e.g., less than 0.3) polydispersity index generally indicates a narrow particle size distribution. A nanoparticle composition may have a polydispersity index from about 0 to about 0.25, such as 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, 0.20, 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, or 0.25. In some embodiments, the polydispersity index of a nanoparticle composition may be from about 0.10 to about 0.20.
[0447]
The zeta potential of a nanoparticle composition may be used to indicate the electrokinetic potential of the composition. For example, the zeta potential may describe the surface charge of a nanoparticle composition. Nanoparticle compositions with relatively low charges, positive or negative, are generally desirable, as more highly charged species may interact undesirably with cells, tissues, and other elements in the body. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of a nanoparticle composition may be from about −10 mV to about +20 mV, from about −10 mV to about +15 mV, from about −10 mV to about +10 mV, from about −10 mV to about +5 mV, from about −10 mV to about 0 mV, from about −10 mV to about −5 mV, from about −5 mV to about +20 mV, from about −5 mV to about +15 mV, from about −5 mV to about +10 mV, from about −5 mV to about +5 mV, from about −5 mV to about 0 mV, from about 0 mV to about +20 mV, from about 0 mV to about +15 mV, from about 0 mV to about +10 mV, from about 0 mV to about +5 mV, from about +5 mV to about +20 mV, from about +5 mV to about +15 mV, or from about +5 mV to about +10 mV.
[0448]
The efficiency of encapsulation of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic describes the amount of therapeutic and/or prophylactic that is encapsulated or otherwise associated with a nanoparticle composition after preparation, relative to the initial amount provided. The encapsulation efficiency is desirably high (e.g., close to 100%). The encapsulation efficiency may be measured, for example, by comparing the amount of therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a solution containing the nanoparticle composition before and after breaking up the nanoparticle composition with one or more organic solvents or detergents. Fluorescence may be used to measure the amount of free therapeutic and/or prophylactic (e.g., RNA) in a solution. For the nanoparticle compositions described herein, the encapsulation efficiency of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic may be at least 50%, for example 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%. In some embodiments, the encapsulation efficiency may be at least 80%. In certain embodiments, the encapsulation efficiency may be at least 90%.
[0449]
A nanoparticle composition may optionally comprise one or more coatings. For example, a nanoparticle composition may be formulated in a capsule, film, or tablet having a coating. A capsule, film, or tablet including a composition described herein may have any useful size, tensile strength, hardness, or density.
Pharmaceutical Compositions
[0450]
Nanoparticle compositions may be formulated in whole or in part as pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions may include one or more nanoparticle compositions. For example, a pharmaceutical composition may include one or more nanoparticle compositions including one or more different therapeutic and/or prophylactics. Pharmaceutical compositions may further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or accessory ingredients such as those described herein. General guidelines for the formulation and manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and agents are available, for example, in Remington's The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Edition, A. R. Gennaro; Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md., 2006. Conventional excipients and accessory ingredients may be used in any pharmaceutical composition, except insofar as any conventional excipient or accessory ingredient may be incompatible with one or more components of a nanoparticle composition. An excipient or accessory ingredient may be incompatible with a component of a nanoparticle composition if its combination with the component may result in any undesirable biological effect or otherwise deleterious effect.
[0451]
In some embodiments, one or more excipients or accessory ingredients may make up greater than 50% of the total mass or volume of a pharmaceutical composition including a nanoparticle composition. For example, the one or more excipients or accessory ingredients may make up 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or more of a pharmaceutical convention. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% pure. In some embodiments, an excipient is approved for use in humans and for veterinary use. In some embodiments, an excipient is approved by United States Food and Drug Administration. In some embodiments, an excipient is pharmaceutical grade. In some embodiments, an excipient meets the standards of the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), the European Pharmacopoeia (EP), the British Pharmacopoeia, and/or the International Pharmacopoeia.
[0452]
Relative amounts of the one or more nanoparticle compositions, the one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and/or any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the present disclosure will vary, depending upon the identity, size, and/or condition of the subject treated and further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered. By way of example, a pharmaceutical composition may comprise between 0.1% and 100% (wt/wt) of one or more nanoparticle compositions.
[0453]
In certain embodiments, the nanoparticle compositions and/or pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure are refrigerated or frozen for storage and/or shipment (e.g., being stored at a temperature of 4° C. or lower, such as a temperature between about −150° C. and about 0° C. or between about −80° C. and about −20° C. (e.g., about −5° C., −10° C., −15° C., −20° C., −25° C., −30° C., −40° C., −50° C., −60° C., −70° C., −80° C., −90° C., −130° C. or −150° C.). For example, the pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of any of Formulae (I), (IA), (II), and (IIa)-(IIe) is a solution that is refrigerated for storage and/or shipment at, for example, about −20° C., −30° C., −40° C., −50° C., −60° C., −70° C., or −80° C. In certain embodiments, the disclosure also relates to a method of increasing stability of the nanoparticle compositions and/or pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of any of Formulae (I), (IA), (II), and (IIa)-(IIe) by storing the nanoparticle compositions and/or pharmaceutical compositions at a temperature of 4° C. or lower, such as a temperature between about −150° C. and about 0° C. or between about −80° C. and about −20° C., e.g., about −5° C., −10° C., −15° C., −20° C., −25° C., −30° C., −40° C., −50° C., −60° C., −70° C., −80° C., −90° C., −130° C. or −150° C.). For example, the nanoparticle compositions and/or pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein are stable for about at least 1 week, at least 2 weeks, at least 3 weeks, at least 4 weeks, at least 5 weeks, at least 6 weeks, at least 1 month, at least 2 months, at least 4 months, at least 6 months, at least 8 months, at least 10 months, at least 12 months, at least 14 months, at least 16 months, at least 18 months, at least 20 months, at least 22 months, or at least 24 months, e.g., at a temperature of 4° C. or lower (e.g., between about 4° C. and −20° C.). In one embodiment, the formulation is stabilized for at least 4 weeks at about 4° C. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure comprises a nanoparticle composition disclosed herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier selected from one or more of Tris, an acetate (e.g., sodium acetate), an citrate (e.g., sodium citrate), saline, PBS, and sucrose. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure has a pH value between about 7 and 8 (e.g., 6.8 6.9, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9 or 8.0, or between 7.5 and 8 or between 7 and 7.8). For example, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure comprises a nanoparticle composition disclosed herein, Tris, saline and sucrose, and has a pH of about 7.5-8, which is suitable for storage and/or shipment at, for example, about −20° C. For example, a pharmaceutical composition of the disclosure comprises a nanoparticle composition disclosed herein and PBS and has a pH of about 7-7.8, suitable for storage and/or shipment at, for example, about 4° C. or lower. “Stability,” “stabilized,” and “stable” in the context of the present disclosure refers to the resistance of nanoparticle compositions and/or pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein to chemical or physical changes (e.g., degradation, particle size change, aggregation, change in encapsulation, etc.) under given manufacturing, preparation, transportation, storage and/or in-use conditions, e.g., when stress is applied such as shear force, freeze/thaw stress, etc.
[0454]
Nanoparticle compositions and/or pharmaceutical compositions including one or more nanoparticle compositions may be administered to any patient or subject, including those patients or subjects that may benefit from a therapeutic effect provided by the delivery of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic to one or more particular cells, tissues, organs, or systems or groups thereof, such as the renal system. Although the descriptions provided herein of nanoparticle compositions and pharmaceutical compositions including nanoparticle compositions are principally directed to compositions which are suitable for administration to humans, it will be understood by the skilled artisan that such compositions are generally suitable for administration to any other mammal. Modification of compositions suitable for administration to humans in order to render the compositions suitable for administration to various animals is well understood, and the ordinarily skilled veterinary pharmacologist can design and/or perform such modification with merely ordinary, if any, experimentation. Subjects to which administration of the compositions is contemplated include, but are not limited to, humans, other primates, and other mammals, including commercially relevant mammals such as cattle, pigs, hoses, sheep, cats, dogs, mice, and/or rats.
[0455]
A pharmaceutical composition including one or more nanoparticle compositions may be prepared by any method known or hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology. In general, such preparatory methods include bringing the active ingredient into association with an excipient and/or one or more other accessory ingredients, and then, if desirable or necessary, dividing, shaping, and/or packaging the product into a desired single- or multi-dose unit.
[0456]
A pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the present disclosure may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in bulk, as a single unit dose, and/or as a plurality of single unit doses. As used herein, a “unit dose” is discrete amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a predetermined amount of the active ingredient (e.g., nanoparticle composition). The amount of the active ingredient is generally equal to the dosage of the active ingredient which would be administered to a subject and/or a convenient fraction of such a dosage such as, for example, one-half or one-third of such a dosage.
[0457]
Pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared in a variety of forms suitable for a variety of routes and methods of administration. For example, pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared in liquid dosage forms (e.g., emulsions, microemulsions, nanoemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs), injectable forms, solid dosage forms (e.g., capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules), dosage forms for topical and/or transdermal administration (e.g., ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants, and patches), suspensions, powders, and other forms.
[0458]
Liquid dosage forms for oral and parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, nanoemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and/or elixirs. In addition to active ingredients, liquid dosage forms may comprise inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, oral compositions can include additional therapeutic and/or prophylactics, additional agents such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and/or perfuming agents. In certain embodiments for parenteral administration, compositions are mixed with solubilizing agents such as Cremophor®, alcohols, oils, modified oils, glycols, polysorbates, cyclodextrins, polymers, and/or combinations thereof.
[0459]
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing agents, wetting agents, and/or suspending agents. Sterile injectable preparations may be sterile injectable solutions, suspensions, and/or emulsions in nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluents and/or solvents, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P., and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids such as oleic acid can be used in the preparation of injectables.
[0460]
Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, and/or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.
[0461]
In order to prolong the effect of an active ingredient, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the active ingredient from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.
[0462]
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are typically suppositories which can be prepared by mixing compositions with suitable non-irritating excipients such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active ingredient.
[0463]
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, films, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, an active ingredient is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or fillers or extenders (e.g. starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid), binders (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia), humectants (e.g., glycerol), disintegrating agents (e.g., agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate), solution retarding agents (e.g., paraffin), absorption accelerators (e.g., quaternary ammonium compounds), wetting agents (e.g., cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate), absorbents (e.g., kaolin and bentonite clay, silicates), and lubricants (e.g., talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate), and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may comprise buffering agents.
[0464]
Solid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. Solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally comprise opacifying agents and can be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
[0465]
Dosage forms for topical and/or transdermal administration of a composition may include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants, and/or patches. Generally, an active ingredient is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and/or any needed preservatives and/or buffers as may be required. Additionally, the present disclosure contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which often have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms may be prepared, for example, by dissolving and/or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Alternatively or additionally, rate may be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane and/or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix and/or gel.
[0466]
Suitable devices for use in delivering intradermal pharmaceutical compositions described herein include short needle devices such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,886,499; 5,190,521; 5,328,483; 5,527,288; 4,270,537; 5,015,235; 5,141,496; and 5,417,662. Intradermal compositions may be administered by devices which limit the effective penetration length of a needle into the skin, such as those described in PCT publication WO 99/34850 and functional equivalents thereof. Jet injection devices which deliver liquid compositions to the dermis via a liquid jet injector and/or via a needle which pierces the stratum corneum and produces a jet which reaches the dermis are suitable. Jet injection devices are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,480,381; 5,599,302; 5,334,144; 5,993,412; 5,649,912; 5,569,189; 5,704,911; 5,383,851; 5,893,397; 5,466,220; 5,339,163; 5,312,335; 5,503,627; 5,064,413; 5,520,639; 4,596,556; 4,790,824; 4,941,880; 4,940,460; and PCT publications WO 97/37705 and WO 97/13537. Ballistic powder/particle delivery devices which use compressed gas to accelerate vaccine in powder form through the outer layers of the skin to the dermis are suitable. Alternatively or additionally, conventional syringes may be used in the classical mantoux method of intradermal administration.
[0467]
Formulations suitable for topical administration include, but are not limited to, liquid and/or semi liquid preparations such as liniments, lotions, oil in water and/or water in oil emulsions such as creams, ointments and/or pastes, and/or solutions and/or suspensions. Topically-administrable formulations may, for example, comprise from about 1% to about 10% (wt/wt) active ingredient, although the concentration of active ingredient may be as high as the solubility limit of the active ingredient in the solvent. Formulations for topical administration may further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein.
[0468]
A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for pulmonary administration via the buccal cavity. Such a formulation may comprise dry particles which comprise the active ingredient. Such compositions are conveniently in the form of dry powders for administration using a device comprising a dry powder reservoir to which a stream of propellant may be directed to disperse the powder and/or using a self-propelling solvent/powder dispensing container such as a device comprising the active ingredient dissolved and/or suspended in a low-boiling propellant in a sealed container. Dry powder compositions may include a solid fine powder diluent such as sugar and are conveniently provided in a unit dose form.
[0469]
Low boiling propellants generally include liquid propellants having a boiling point of below 65° F. at atmospheric pressure. Generally the propellant may constitute 50% to 99.9% (wt/wt) of the composition, and active ingredient may constitute 0.1% to 20% (wt/wt) of the composition. A propellant may further comprise additional ingredients such as a liquid non-ionic and/or solid anionic surfactant and/or a solid diluent (which may have a particle size of the same order as particles comprising the active ingredient).
[0470]
Pharmaceutical compositions formulated for pulmonary delivery may provide an active ingredient in the form of droplets of a solution and/or suspension. Such formulations may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold as aqueous and/or dilute alcoholic solutions and/or suspensions, optionally sterile, comprising active ingredient, and may conveniently be administered using any nebulization and/or atomization device. Such formulations may further comprise one or more additional ingredients including, but not limited to, a flavoring agent such as saccharin sodium, a volatile oil, a buffering agent, a surface active agent, and/or a preservative such as methylhydroxybenzoate. Droplets provided by this route of administration may have an average diameter in the range from about 1 nm to about 200 nm.
[0471]
Formulations described herein as being useful for pulmonary delivery are useful for intranasal delivery of a pharmaceutical composition. Another formulation suitable for intranasal administration is a coarse powder comprising the active ingredient and having an average particle from about 0.2 μm to 500 μm. Such a formulation is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close to the nose.
[0472]
Formulations suitable for nasal administration may, for example, comprise from about as little as 0.1% (wt/wt) and as much as 100% (wt/wt) of active ingredient, and may comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for buccal administration. Such formulations may, for example, be in the form of tablets and/or lozenges made using conventional methods, and may, for example, 0.1% to 20% (wt/wt) active ingredient, the balance comprising an orally dissolvable and/or degradable composition and, optionally, one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. Alternately, formulations suitable for buccal administration may comprise a powder and/or an aerosolized and/or atomized solution and/or suspension comprising active ingredient. Such powdered, aerosolized, and/or aerosolized formulations, when dispersed, may have an average particle and/or droplet size in the range from about 0.1 nm to about 200 nm, and may further comprise one or more of any additional ingredients described herein.
[0473]
A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for ophthalmic administration. Such formulations may, for example, be in the form of eye drops including, for example, a 0.1/1.0% (wt/wt) solution and/or suspension of the active ingredient in an aqueous or oily liquid excipient. Such drops may further comprise buffering agents, salts, and/or one or more other of any additional ingredients described herein. Other ophthalmically-administrable formulations which are useful include those which comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form and/or in a liposomal preparation. Ear drops and/or eye drops are contemplated as being within the scope of this present disclosure.
Methods of Producing Polypeptides in Cells
[0474]
The present disclosure provides methods of producing a polypeptide of interest in a mammalian cell. Methods of producing polypeptides involve contacting a cell with a nanoparticle composition including an mRNA encoding the polypeptide of interest. Upon contacting the cell with the nanoparticle composition, the mRNA may be taken up and translated in the cell to produce the polypeptide of interest.
[0475]
In general, the step of contacting a mammalian cell with a nanoparticle composition including an mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest may be performed in vivo, ex vivo, in culture, or in vitro. The amount of nanoparticle composition contacted with a cell, and/or the amount of mRNA therein, may depend on the type of cell or tissue being contacted, the means of administration, the physiochemical characteristics of the nanoparticle composition and the mRNA (e.g., size, charge, and chemical composition) therein, and other factors. In general, an effective amount of the nanoparticle composition will allow for efficient polypeptide production in the cell. Metrics for efficiency may include polypeptide translation (indicated by polypeptide expression), level of mRNA degradation, and immune response indicators.
[0476]
The step of contacting a nanoparticle composition including an mRNA with a cell may involve or cause transfection. A phospholipid including in the lipid component of a nanoparticle composition may facilitate transfection and/or increase transfection efficiency, for example, by interacting and/or fusing with a cellular or intracellular membrane. Transfection may allow for the translation of the mRNA within the cell.
[0477]
In some embodiments, the nanoparticle compositions described herein may be used therapeutically. For example, an mRNA included in a nanoparticle composition may encode a therapeutic polypeptide (e.g., in a translatable region) and produce the therapeutic polypeptide upon contacting and/or entry (e.g., transfection) into a cell. In other embodiments, an mRNA included in a nanoparticle composition may encode a polypeptide that may improve or increase the immunity of a subject. For example, an mRNA may encode a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor or trastuzumab.
[0478]
In certain embodiments, an mRNA included in a nanoparticle composition may encode a recombinant polypeptide that may replace one or more polypeptides that may be substantially absent in a cell contacted with the nanoparticle composition. The one or more substantially absent polypeptides may be lacking due to a genetic mutation of the encoding gene or a regulatory pathway thereof. Alternatively, a recombinant polypeptide produced by translation of the mRNA may antagonize the activity of an endogenous protein present in, on the surface of, or secreted from the cell. An antagonistic recombinant polypeptide may be desirable to combat deleterious effects caused by activities of the endogenous protein, such as altered activities or localization caused by mutation. In another alternative, a recombinant polypeptide produced by translation of the mRNA may indirectly or directly antagonize the activity of a biological moiety present in, on the surface of, or secreted from the cell. Antagonized biological moieties may include, but are not limited to, lipids (e.g., cholesterol), lipoproteins (e.g., low density lipoprotein), nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule toxins. Recombinant polypeptides produced by translation of the mRNA may be engineered for localization within the cell, such as within a specific compartment such as the nucleus, or may be engineered for secretion from the cell or for translocation to the plasma membrane of the cell.
[0479]
In some embodiments, contacting a cell with a nanoparticle composition including an mRNA may reduce the innate immune response of a cell to an exogenous nucleic acid. A cell may be contacted with a first nanoparticle composition including a first amount of a first exogenous mRNA including a translatable region and the level of the innate immune response of the cell to the first exogenous mRNA may be determined. Subsequently, the cell may be contacted with a second composition including a second amount of the first exogenous mRNA, the second amount being a lesser amount of the first exogenous mRNA compared to the first amount. Alternatively, the second composition may include a first amount of a second exogenous mRNA that is different from the first exogenous mRNA. The steps of contacting the cell with the first and second compositions may be repeated one or more times. Additionally, efficiency of polypeptide production (e.g., translation) in the cell may be optionally determined, and the cell may be re-contacted with the first and/or second composition repeatedly until a target protein production efficiency is achieved.
Methods of Delivering Therapeutic Agents to Cells and Organs
[0480]
The present disclosure provides methods of delivering a therapeutic and/or prophylactic to a mammalian cell or organ. Delivery of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic to a cell involves administering a nanoparticle composition including the therapeutic and/or prophylactic to a subject, where administration of the composition involves contacting the cell with the composition. For example, a protein, cytotoxic agent, radioactive ion, chemotherapeutic agent, or nucleic acid (such as an RNA, e.g., mRNA) may be delivered to a cell or organ. In the instance that a therapeutic and/or prophylactic is an mRNA, upon contacting a cell with the nanoparticle composition, a translatable mRNA may be translated in the cell to produce a polypeptide of interest. However, mRNAs that are substantially not translatable may also be delivered to cells. Substantially non-translatable mRNAs may be useful as vaccines and/or may sequester translational components of a cell to reduce expression of other species in the cell.
[0481]
In some embodiments, a nanoparticle composition may target a particular type or class of cells (e.g., cells of a particular organ or system thereof). For example, a nanoparticle composition including a therapeutic and/or prophylactic of interest may be specifically delivered to a mammalian liver, kidney, spleen, femur, or lung. Specific delivery to a particular class of cells, an organ, or a system or group thereof implies that a higher proportion of nanoparticle compositions including a therapeutic and/or prophylactic are delivered to the destination (e.g., tissue) of interest relative to other destinations, e.g., upon administration of a nanoparticle composition to a mammal. In some embodiments, specific delivery may result in a greater than 2 fold, 5 fold, 10 fold, 15 fold, or 20 fold increase in the amount of therapeutic and/or prophylactic per 1 g of tissue of the targeted destination (e.g., tissue of interest, such as a liver) as compared to another destination (e.g., the spleen). In some embodiments, the tissue of interest is selected from the group consisting of a liver, kidney, a lung, a spleen, a femur, an ocular tissue (e.g., via intraocular, subretinal, or intravitreal injection), vascular endothelium in vessels (e.g., intra-coronary or intra-femoral) or kidney, and tumor tissue (e.g., via intratumoral injection).
[0482]
As another example of targeted or specific delivery, an mRNA that encodes a protein-binding partner (e.g., an antibody or functional fragment thereof, a scaffold protein, or a peptide) or a receptor on a cell surface may be included in a nanoparticle composition. An mRNA may additionally or instead be used to direct the synthesis and extracellular localization of lipids, carbohydrates, or other biological moieties. Alternatively, other therapeutic and/or prophylactics or elements (e.g., lipids or ligands) of a nanoparticle composition may be selected based on their affinity for particular receptors (e.g., low density lipoprotein receptors) such that a nanoparticle composition may more readily interact with a target cell population including the receptors. For example, ligands may include, but are not limited to, members of a specific binding pair, antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, Fv fragments, single chain Fv (scFv) fragments, Fab′ fragments, F(ab′)2 fragments, single domain antibodies, camelized antibodies and fragments thereof, humanized antibodies and fragments thereof, and multivalent versions thereof; multivalent binding reagents including mono- or bi-specific antibodies such as disulfide stabilized Fv fragments, scFv tandems, diabodies, tribodies, or tetrabodies; and aptamers, receptors, and fusion proteins.
[0483]
In some embodiments, a ligand may be a surface-bound antibody, which can permit tuning of cell targeting specificity. This is especially useful since highly specific antibodies can be raised against an epitope of interest for the desired targeting site. In one embodiment, multiple antibodies are expressed on the surface of a cell, and each antibody can have a different specificity for a desired target. Such approaches can increase the avidity and specificity of targeting interactions.
[0484]
A ligand can be selected, e.g., by a person skilled in the biological arts, based on the desired localization or function of the cell. For example an estrogen receptor ligand, such as tamoxifen, can target cells to estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells that have an increased number of estrogen receptors on the cell surface. Other non-limiting examples of ligand/receptor interactions include CCR1 (e.g., for treatment of inflamed joint tissues or brain in rheumatoid arthritis, and/or multiple sclerosis), CCR7, CCR8 (e.g., targeting to lymph node tissue), CCR6, CCR9,CCR10 (e.g., to target to intestinal tissue), CCR4, CCR10 (e.g., for targeting to skin), CXCR4 (e.g., for general enhanced transmigration), HCELL (e.g., for treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders, bone marrow), Alpha4beta7 (e.g., for intestinal mucosa targeting), and VLA-4NCAM-1 (e.g., targeting to endothelium). In general, any receptor involved in targeting (e.g., cancer metastasis) can be harnessed for use in the methods and compositions described herein.
[0485]
Targeted cells may include, but are not limited to, hepatocytes, epithelial cells, hematopoietic cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, lung cells, bone cells, stem cells, mesenchymal cells, neural cells, cardiac cells, adipocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle cells, beta cells, pituitary cells, synovial lining cells, ovarian cells, testicular cells, fibroblasts, B cells, T cells, reticulocytes, leukocytes, granulocytes, and tumor cells.
[0486]
In some embodiments, a nanoparticle composition may target hepatocytes. Apolipoprotiens such as apolipoprotein E (apoE) have been shown to associate with neutral or near neutral lipid-containing nanoparticle compositions in the body, and are known to associate with receptors such as low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) found on the surface of hepatocytes. Thus, a nanoparticle composition including a lipid component with a neutral or near neutral charge that is administered to a subject may acquire apoE in a subject's body and may subsequently deliver a therapeutic and/or prophylactic (e.g., an RNA) to hepatocytes including LDLRs in a targeted manner.
Methods of Treating Diseases and Disorders
[0487]
Nanoparticle compositions may be useful for treating a disease, disorder, or condition. In particular, such compositions may be useful in treating a disease, disorder, or condition characterized by missing or aberrant protein or polypeptide activity. For example, a nanoparticle composition comprising an mRNA encoding a missing or aberrant polypeptide may be administered or delivered to a cell. Subsequent translation of the mRNA may produce the polypeptide, thereby reducing or eliminating an issue caused by the absence of or aberrant activity caused by the polypeptide. Because translation may occur rapidly, the methods and compositions may be useful in the treatment of acute diseases, disorders, or conditions such as sepsis, stroke, and myocardial infarction. A therapeutic and/or prophylactic included in a nanoparticle composition may also be capable of altering the rate of transcription of a given species, thereby affecting gene expression.
[0488]
Diseases, disorders, and/or conditions characterized by dysfunctional or aberrant protein or polypeptide activity for which a composition may be administered include, but are not limited to, rare diseases, infectious diseases (as both vaccines and therapeutics), cancer and proliferative diseases, genetic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis), autoimmune diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, cardio- and reno-vascular diseases, and metabolic diseases. Multiple diseases, disorders, and/or conditions may be characterized by missing (or substantially diminished such that proper protein function does not occur) protein activity. Such proteins may not be present, or they may be essentially non-functional. A specific example of a dysfunctional protein is the missense mutation variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which produce a dysfunctional protein variant of CFTR protein, which causes cystic fibrosis. The present disclosure provides a method for treating such diseases, disorders, and/or conditions in a subject by administering a nanoparticle composition including an RNA and a lipid component including a lipid according to Formula (I), a phospholipid (optionally unsaturated), a PEG lipid, and a structural lipid, wherein the RNA may be an mRNA encoding a polypeptide that antagonizes or otherwise overcomes an aberrant protein activity present in the cell of the subject.
[0489]
The disclosure provides methods involving administering nanoparticle compositions including one or more therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents and pharmaceutical compositions including the same. The terms therapeutic and prophylactic can be used interchangeably herein with respect to features and embodiments of the present disclosure. Therapeutic compositions, or imaging, diagnostic, or prophylactic compositions thereof, may be administered to a subject using any reasonable amount and any route of administration effective for preventing, treating, diagnosing, or imaging a disease, disorder, and/or condition and/or any other purpose. The specific amount administered to a given subject may vary depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject; the purpose of the administration; the particular composition; the mode of administration; and the like. Compositions in accordance with the present disclosure may be formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of a composition of the present disclosure will be decided by an attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective, prophylactically effective, or otherwise appropriate dose level (e.g., for imaging) for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the severity and identify of a disorder being treated, if any; the one or more therapeutic and/or prophylactics employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific pharmaceutical composition employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific pharmaceutical composition employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.
[0490]
A nanoparticle composition including one or more therapeutic and/or prophylactics may be administered by any route. In some embodiments, compositions, including prophylactic, diagnostic, or imaging compositions including one or more nanoparticle compositions described herein, are administered by one or more of a variety of routes, including oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial, intramedullary, intrathecal, subcutaneous, intraventricular, trans- or intra-dermal, interdermal, rectal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, intraocular, subretinal, intravitreal, topical (e.g. by powders, ointments, creams, gels, lotions, and/or drops), mucosal, nasal, buccal, enteral, vitreal, intratumoral, sublingual, intranasal; by intratracheal instillation, bronchial instillation, and/or inhalation; as an oral spray and/or powder, nasal spray, and/or aerosol, and/or through a portal vein catheter. In some embodiments, a composition may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, intradermally, intra-arterially, intratumorally, subcutaneously, intraocularly, subretinally, intravitreally, or by inhalation. However, the present disclosure encompasses the delivery or administration of compositions described herein by any appropriate route taking into consideration likely advances in the sciences of drug delivery. In general, the most appropriate route of administration will depend upon a variety of factors including the nature of the nanoparticle composition including one or more therapeutic and/or prophylactics (e.g., its stability in various bodily environments such as the bloodstream and gastrointestinal tract), the condition of the patient (e.g., whether the patient is able to tolerate particular routes of administration), etc.
[0491]
In certain embodiments, compositions in accordance with the present disclosure may be administered at dosage levels sufficient to deliver from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.005 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 2 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 5 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, from about 0.005 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, from about 1 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, from about 2 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, from about 0.005 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, from about 1 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, from about 2 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, from about 0.005 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 0.25 mg/kg, from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 0.25 mg/kg, from about 0.005 mg/kg to about 0.25 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 0.25 mg/kg, from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 0.25 mg/kg, or from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 0.25 mg/kg of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic (e.g., an mRNA) in a given dose, where a dose of 1 mg/kg (mpk) provides 1 mg of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic per 1 kg of subject body weight. In some embodiments, a dose of about 0.001 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic (e.g., mRNA) of a nanoparticle composition may be administered. In other embodiments, a dose of about 0.005 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic may be administered. In certain embodiments, a dose of about 0.1 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg may be administered. In other embodiments, a dose of about 0.05 mg/kg to about 0.25 mg/kg may be administered. A dose may be administered one or more times per day, in the same or a different amount, to obtain a desired level of mRNA expression and/or therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic, or imaging effect. The desired dosage may be delivered, for example, three times a day, two times a day, once a day, every other day, every third day, every week, every two weeks, every three weeks, or every four weeks. In certain embodiments, the desired dosage may be delivered using multiple administrations (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, or more administrations). In some embodiments, a single dose may be administered, for example, prior to or after a surgical procedure or in the instance of an acute disease, disorder, or condition.
[0492]
Nanoparticle compositions including one or more therapeutic and/or prophylactics may be used in combination with one or more other therapeutic, prophylactic, diagnostic, or imaging agents. By “in combination with,” it is not intended to imply that the agents must be administered at the same time and/or formulated for delivery together, although these methods of delivery are within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, one or more nanoparticle compositions including one or more different therapeutic and/or prophylactics may be administered in combination. Compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. In general, each agent will be administered at a dose and/or on a time schedule determined for that agent. In some embodiments, the present disclosure encompasses the delivery of compositions, or imaging, diagnostic, or prophylactic compositions thereof in combination with agents that improve their bioavailability, reduce and/or modify their metabolism, inhibit their excretion, and/or modify their distribution within the body.
[0493]
It will further be appreciated that therapeutically, prophylactically, diagnostically, or imaging active agents utilized in combination may be administered together in a single composition or administered separately in different compositions. In general, it is expected that agents utilized in combination will be utilized at levels that do not exceed the levels at which they are utilized individually. In some embodiments, the levels utilized in combination may be lower than those utilized individually.
[0494]
The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, a composition useful for treating cancer may be administered concurrently with a chemotherapeutic agent), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects, such as infusion related reactions).
[0495]
A nanoparticle composition may be used in combination with an agent to increase the effectiveness and/or therapeutic window of the composition. Such an agent may be, for example, an anti-inflammatory compound, a steroid (e.g., a corticosteroid), a statin, an estradiol, a BTK inhibitor, an S1P1 agonist, a glucocorticoid receptor modulator (GRM), or an anti-histamine. In some embodiments, a nanoparticle composition may be used in combination with dexamethasone, methotrexate, acetaminophen, an H1 receptor blocker, or an H2 receptor blocker. In some embodiments, a method of treating a subject in need thereof or of delivering a therapeutic and/or prophylactic to a subject (e.g., a mammal) may involve pre-treating the subject with one or more agents prior to administering a nanoparticle composition. For example, a subject may be pre-treated with a useful amount (e.g., 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 90 mg, 100 mg, or any other useful amount) of dexamethasone, methotrexate, acetaminophen, an H1 receptor blocker, or an H2 receptor blocker. Pre-treatment may occur 24 or fewer hours (e.g., 24 hours, 20 hours, 16 hours, 12 hours, 8 hours, 4 hours, 2 hours, 1 hour, 50 minutes, 40 minutes, 30 minutes, 20 minutes, or 10 minutes) before administration of the nanoparticle composition and may occur one, two, or more times in, for example, increasing dosage amounts.
[0496]

In the reaction schemes described herein, multiple stereoisomers may be produced. When no particular stereoisomer is indicated, it is understood to mean all possible stereoisomers that could be produced from the reaction. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the reactions can be optimized to give one isomer preferentially, or new schemes may be devised to produce a single isomer. If mixtures are produced, techniques such as preparative thin layer chromatography, preparative HPLC, preparative chiral HPLC, or preparative SFC may be used to separate the isomers.
[0513]
As illustrated in Scheme 1 above, 8-bromooctanoic acid reacts with an alcohol a1 (e.g., heptadecan-9-ol) to afford an ester b1 (e.g., heptadecan-9-yl 8-bromooctanoate). Step 1 can take place in an organic solvent (e.g., dichloromethane) in the presence of, e.g., N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and DMAP. Step 1 can take place at room temperature for 18 h. Next, ester b1 reacts with 2-aminoethan-1-ol to afford amine c1 (e.g., heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)amino)octanoate). Step 2 can take place in ethanol at, e.g., a temperature of about 60° C. Then amine c1 reacts with an bromoalkyl R1—Br (e.g., 1-bromotetradecane) to afford compound d1 (e.g., heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)(tetradecyl)amino)octanoate). Step 3 can take place in ethanol in the presence of N,N-diisopropylethylamine.
[0514]
As illustrated in Scheme 2 above, an acid a2 (t is an integer between 1 and 7; e.g., 8-bromooctanoic acid) reacts with an alcohol b2 (e.g., nonan-1-ol) to afford an ester c2 (e.g., nonyl-8-bromooctanoate). Step 1 can take place in an organic solvent (e.g., dichloromethane) in the presence of, e.g., N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and DMAP. Alcohol e2 (e.g., heptadecan-9-ol) can be obtained from reacting aldehyde d2 (e.g., nonanal) with a Grignard reagent R3—MgX (e.g., n-C8H17MgBr) via Step 2. Next, 8-bromooctanoic acid reacts with an alcohol e2 (e.g., heptadecan-9-ol) to afford an ester f2 (e.g., heptadecan-9-yl 8-bromooctanoate). Step 3 can take place in an organic solvent (e.g., dichloromethane) in the presence of, e.g., N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and DMAP. Next, ester f2 reacts with 2-aminoethan-1-ol to afford amine g2 (e.g., heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)amino)octanoate). Step 4 can take place in ethanol in the presence of i-Pr2EtN. Then amine g2 reacts with ester c2 (e.g., nonyl-8-bromooctanoate) to afford compound h2 (e.g., heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)(8-(nonyloxy)-8-oxooctyl)amino)octanoate). Step 5 can take place in an organic solvent (e.g., a mixture of CPME and MeCN), in the presence of a base (such as an inorganic base (e.g., K2CO3) or non-nucleophilic organic base (e.g., i-Pr2EtN)) and a catalyst (e.g., an iodide such as KI or NaI) at, e.g., an elevated temperature (such as at about 70-90° C., e.g., about 80° C.).

Example 2: Production of Nanoparticle Compositions
A. Production of Nanoparticle Compositions
[1422]
In order to investigate safe and efficacious nanoparticle compositions for use in the delivery of therapeutic and/or prophylactics to cells, a range of formulations are prepared and tested. Specifically, the particular elements and ratios thereof in the lipid component of nanoparticle compositions are optimized.
[1423]
Nanoparticles can be made with mixing processes such as microfluidics and T-junction mixing of two fluid streams, one of which contains the therapeutic and/or prophylactic and the other has the lipid components.
[1424]
Lipid compositions are prepared by combining a lipid according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe), a phospholipid (such as DOPE or DSPC, obtainable from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Ala.), a PEG lipid (such as 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol methoxypolyethylene glycol, also known as PEG-DMG, obtainable from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Ala.), and a structural lipid (such as cholesterol, obtainable from Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany, or a corticosteroid (such as prednisolone, dexamethasone, prednisone, and hydrocortisone), or a combination thereof) at concentrations of about 50 mM in ethanol. Solutions should be refrigeration for storage at, for example, −20° C. Lipids are combined to yield desired molar ratios (see, for example, Table 23) and diluted with water and ethanol to a final lipid concentration of between about 5.5 mM and about 25 mM.
[1425]
Nanoparticle compositions including a therapeutic and/or prophylactic and a lipid component are prepared by combining the lipid solution with a solution including the therapeutic and/or prophylactic at lipid component to therapeutic and/or prophylactic wt:wt ratios between about 5:1 and about 50:1. The lipid solution is rapidly injected using a NanoAssemblr microfluidic based system at flow rates between about 10 m1/min and about 18 m1/min into the therapeutic and/or prophylactic solution to produce a suspension with a water to ethanol ratio between about 1:1 and about 4:1.
[1426]
For nanoparticle compositions including an RNA, solutions of the RNA at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml in deionized water are diluted in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at a pH between 3 and 4 to form a stock solution.
[1427]
Nanoparticle compositions can be processed by dialysis to remove ethanol and achieve buffer exchange. Formulations are dialyzed twice against phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, at volumes 200 times that of the primary product using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, Ill.) with a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kD. The first dialysis is carried out at room temperature for 3 hours. The formulations are then dialyzed overnight at 4° C. The resulting nanoparticle suspension is filtered through 0.2 μm sterile filters (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) into glass vials and sealed with crimp closures. Nanoparticle composition solutions of 0.01 mg/ml to 0.10 mg/ml are generally obtained.
[1428]
The method described above induces nano-precipitation and particle formation. Alternative processes including, but not limited to, T-junction and direct injection, may be used to achieve the same nano-precipitation.
B. Characterization of Nanoparticle Compositions
[1429]
A Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) can be used to determine the particle size, the polydispersity index (PDI) and the zeta potential of the nanoparticle compositions in 1×PBS in determining particle size and 15 mM PBS in determining zeta potential.
[1430]
Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy can be used to determine the concentration of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic (e.g., RNA) in nanoparticle compositions. 100 μL of the diluted formulation in 1×PBS is added to 900 μL of a 4:1 (v/v) mixture of methanol and chloroform. After mixing, the absorbance spectrum of the solution is recorded, for example, between 230 nm and 330 nm on a DU 800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, Calif.). The concentration of therapeutic and/or prophylactic in the nanoparticle composition can be calculated based on the extinction coefficient of the therapeutic and/or prophylactic used in the composition and on the difference between the absorbance at a wavelength of, for example, 260 nm and the baseline value at a wavelength of, for example, 330 nm.
[1431]
For nanoparticle compositions including an RNA, a QUANT-IT™ RIBOGREEN® RNA assay (Invitrogen Corporation Carlsbad, Calif.) can be used to evaluate the encapsulation of an RNA by the nanoparticle composition. The samples are diluted to a concentration of approximately 5 μg/mL in a TE buffer solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). 50 μL of the diluted samples are transferred to a polystyrene 96 well plate and either 50 μL of TE buffer or 50 μL of a 2% Triton X-100 solution is added to the wells. The plate is incubated at a temperature of 37° C. for 15 minutes. The RIBOGREEN® reagent is diluted 1:100 in TE buffer, and 100 μL of this solution is added to each well. The fluorescence intensity can be measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Wallac Victor 1420 Multilablel Counter; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) at an excitation wavelength of, for example, about 480 nm and an emission wavelength of, for example, about 520 nm. The fluorescence values of the reagent blank are subtracted from that of each of the samples and the percentage of free RNA is determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity of the intact sample (without addition of Triton X-100) by the fluorescence value of the disrupted sample (caused by the addition of Triton X-100).
C. In Vivo Formulation Studies
[1432]
In order to monitor how effectively various nanoparticle compositions deliver therapeutic and/or prophylactics to targeted cells, different nanoparticle compositions including a particular therapeutic and/or prophylactic (for example, a modified or naturally occurring RNA such as an mRNA) are prepared and administered to rodent populations. Mice are intravenously, intramuscularly, intraarterially, or intratumorally administered a single dose including a nanoparticle composition with a formulation such as those provided in Example 3. In some instances, mice may be made to inhale doses. Dose sizes may range from 0.001 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, where 10 mg/kg describes a dose including 10 mg of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a nanoparticle composition for each 1 kg of body mass of the mouse. A control composition including PBS may also be employed.
[1433]
Upon administration of nanoparticle compositions to mice, dose delivery profiles, dose responses, and toxicity of particular formulations and doses thereof can be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), bioluminescent imaging, or other methods. For nanoparticle compositions including mRNA, time courses of protein expression can also be evaluated. Samples collected from the rodents for evaluation may include blood, sera, and tissue (for example, muscle tissue from the site of an intramuscular injection and internal tissue); sample collection may involve sacrifice of the animals.
[1434]
Nanoparticle compositions including mRNA are useful in the evaluation of the efficacy and usefulness of various formulations for the delivery of therapeutic and/or prophylactics. Higher levels of protein expression induced by administration of a composition including an mRNA will be indicative of higher mRNA translation and/or nanoparticle composition mRNA delivery efficiencies. As the non-RNA components are not thought to affect translational machineries themselves, a higher level of protein expression is likely indicative of a higher efficiency of delivery of the therapeutic and/or prophylactic by a given nanoparticle composition relative to other nanoparticle compositions or the absence thereof.
Example 3: Sample Formulations
[1435]
Nanoparticle compositions including a therapeutic and/or prophylactic can be optimized according to the selection of a compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe), the selection of additional lipids, the amount of each lipid in the lipid component, and the wt:wt ratio of the lipid component to the therapeutic and/or prophylactic, as described herein.
[1436]
Initial studies were performed to compare the delivery efficiency of nanoparticle compositions including various compounds according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe). The cationic lipid MC3 is a current standard in the art. Accordingly, the standard MC3 formulation including about 50 mol % MC3, about 10 mol % DSPC, about 38.5 mol % cholesterol, and about 1.5 mol % PEG-DMG was used as a basis for this study. Nanoparticle compositions including DSPC as a phospholipid, cholesterol as a structural lipid, PEG-DMG as a PEG lipid, an RNA, and a compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) selected from Compounds 1-159, 168-170, and 173-175 were prepared according to or via methods similar to those described in Examples 1 and 2. The ratios of the lipids were 50:10:38.5:1.5 mol % for the lipid according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe):DSPC:cholesterol:PEG-DMG. The RNA used was an mRNA encoding G5 luciferase (Luc) or G5 hEPO. Tables 1A-1B summarize the content and characteristics of the formulations.
[1437]
As shown in Tables 1A-1B, the choice of compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) dramatically affects the size (e.g., diameter), polydispersity index, and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the compositions. Compositions had sizes between approximately 53 nm and 237 nm. Compositions including Compounds 5, 35, 36, 51, 59, 131, 132, 137-139, 145, 148, 155 and 158 produced the largest particles, while compositions including Compounds 9, 21, 29, 30, 65, 7175, 94, 107, 114-116, 119, 124, 133, 149, 150, 152, 174 and 175produced the smallest particles. Polydispersity indices varied between 0.04 and 0.99, while encapsulation efficiencies exceeded 75% for compositions including every tested compound except for Compounds 21, 94107, 132, 148, 155 and 158. The highest encapsulation efficiencies were observed for Compounds 1, 6, 18, 19, 24, 26, 28, 29, 49, 50, 55, 60, 61, 65-70, 72, 74, 75, 101, 109-116, 118, 119, 121, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 149, 152, 153, 156, 159, 169, 170 and 174.

Example 4: Expression of Luc Induced by Sample Formulations
[1438]
The efficacy of the nanoparticle compositions presented in Table 1A was evaluated with a bioluminescence study. Formulations were administered intravenously to mice (n=6) at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg (mpk) and bioluminescence measured at 3, 6, and 24 hour time points. The standard MC3 formulation and, in some instances, a control (e.g., a PBS control) were evaluated for comparison. As is evident in Table 2, at 3 hours, the total flux was highest for compositions including Compounds 4, 28, 32, 48, 66, 128 and 135 and the total flux at 3 h was higher than or comparable to that of MC3 formulations for Compounds 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, 25, 27, 31, 33, 47, 49, 50, 53-55, 60, 61, 65-68, 70, 72, 74, 75, 96, 111, 122, 130, 133, 134, 143, 147, 148, 150, 151 and 153. These compositions also demonstrated higher total flux at 6 and 24 hour time points. Compositions including Compounds 9, 17, 57, 58, 59, 121, 125, 137, 140, 141 and 158 had significantly lower flux at all time points measured. In general, flux decreased as time progressed to less than 10% of the initial flux. These results suggest that the compounds described herein may be useful in transfection applications.

The total flux (measured by area under the curve, AUC) induced by administration of a formulation including a given lipid relative to that induced by administration of a formulation including MC3 was also measured for several lipids. As shown in Table 3A (i.v. administration), the flux induced by formulations including Compounds 48 and 49 measured at 6 h was ten times higher than that induced by the MC3 formulation. Formulations including Compounds 50, 54, and 55 also demonstrated higher flux than MC3 formulations. As shown in Table 3B, the flux induced by formulations including Compounds 108 and 168 measured at 6 h was fourteen and sixteen times higher than that induced by the MC3 formulation via intramuscular administration (i.m.). Results are also shown in FIG. 8. As shown in Table 3C (i.v. administration), the flux induced by formulations including Compounds 66, 133-135, and 147 measured at 6 h and the total flux were noticeably higher than those induced by the MC3 formulation. As shown in Table 3D, the total flux induced by formulations including Compounds 96, 148, and 151 measured at 6 h was noticeably higher than that induced by the MC3 formulation.

Example 5: Expression of Luc Induced by Sample Formulations in Different Organs
[1440]
The efficacy of the nanoparticle compositions presented in Table 1A was further evaluated by measuring the expression of modified luciferase in the liver, lung, spleen, and femur upon administration of a given composition. Formulations were administered intravenously to mice (n=3) at a dosage of 0.5 mpk and bioluminescence measured after 6 hours. The standard MC3 formulation and a PBS control were also tested. As is evident in Table 4, flux for nearly all species was higher in the liver compared to other tissues. Flux in the liver was highest for compositions including 3, 28, 33, 48, 96 and 135 and comparable to that of MC3 formulations for compositions including Compounds 2, 4, 6, 7, 18, 20, 24-27, 30-32, 34, 47, 49, 50, 53-56, 60, 65, 67, 68, 74, 75, 111, 113, 122, 128, 130, 133, 134, 143, 147-151, 153 and 157. Flux in the liver was lowest for compositions including Compounds 58, 59, 137, and 141. Flux in the spleen was highest for compositions including Compounds 4, 7, 33, 34, 48, 53, 108, 129, 130, and 148, and lowest for compositions including Compounds 9, 59, 124, and 141. Similar results were observed in the lung and femur.

Example 6A: Expression Induced by Sample Formulations Upon Intramuscular Administration
[1441]
Sample formulations including both modified luciferase (Luc) mRNA and H10 mRNA were prepared and administered intramuscularly and the resulting expression and immunogenicity were evaluated simultaneously. Formulations including compounds according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) were prepared and administered at doses of 0.001 and 0.01 mpk (e.g., doses of 0.0005 mpk of a formulation including Luc mRNA and a formulation including H10 mRNA or doses of 0.005 mpk of a formulation including Luc mRNA and a formulation including H10 mRNA). As shown in Table 5A, Compound 20 exhibited the highest expression at both dose levels. The low dose of Compound 20 showed equivalent expression to the high dose of MC3. Formulations including other compounds also showed multi-fold enhancement in expression relative to MC3.

Example 7: Cytokine Production Induced by Sample Formulations
[1444]
The introduction of foreign material into a mammalian body induces an innate immune response that promotes cytokine production. Such immune responses to, for example, nanoparticle compositions including therapeutic and/or prophylactics, are undesirable. The induction of certain cytokines is thus measured to evaluate the efficacy of nanoparticle compositions. The concentrations of various cytokines in mice upon intravenous administration of nanoparticle compositions presented in Table 1A at a dosage of 0.5 mpk was measured at 6 hours. The standard MC3 formulation and a PBS control were also tested. As is evident in Table 7, IL-6 induction was highest for compositions including Compounds 1, 3, 9, 19, and 26, while IP-10 induction was highest for compositions including Compounds 3, 4, 7, 20, and 26. IL-6 induction was lowest for compositions including Compounds 4, 11, 12, and 28. IP-10 induction was lowest for compositions including Compounds 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 18.

Example 8: Complement Activation Induced by Sample Formulations
[1445]
Complement activation assists in the clearance of pathogens from an organism. As it is undesirable that a subject's body recognize a nanoparticle composition as a foreign invader, low complement system activation upon administration of such a composition is preferred. The complex sC5b-9 is a marker for the activation of the complement system. Thus, human cells were contacted in vitro with nanoparticle compositions according to Table 1A and were evaluated for sC5b-9 levels. Table 8 shows the fold increase in sC5b-9 levels relative to saline for nanoparticle compositions including Compounds 1, 6, 9, 18, 24, 25, 29, and 30. Compositions including Compounds 6 and 18 somewhat increase sC5b-9 levels relative to saline, while compositions including Compounds 1, 9, 24, 29, and 30 slightly decrease sC5b-9 levels relative to saline.

Example 10: Expression of hEPO Induced by Sample Formulations
[1447]
Sample formulations of nanoparticle compositions including different lipids are generally first evaluated according to Luc expression in vivo. The activity of several such compositions was further evaluated using an mRNA encoding hEPO. Nanoparticle compositions including Compounds 6, 18, 25, 30, 108-112, 60, and 122, or MC3 were prepared according to Example 2. As shown in Tables 10 and 1B supra, each composition had a similar particle size and encapsulation efficiency.

The expression of hEPO and cytokine induction in mice intravenously administered a nanoparticle composition at a dose of 0.5 mpk were measured at 3, 6, and 24 hours. The resultant hEPO and cytokine levels are summarized in Table 11A. Compositions including Compounds 6 and 18 yielded higher hEPO concentrations than MC3 formulations at each time point. The expression of hEPO in mice intramuscularly administered a nanoparticle composition from Table 1B at a dose of 0.01 mpk were measured at 3, 6, and 24 hours. The resultant hEPO levels are summarized in Table 11B. Compositions including Compounds 18, 25, 30, 108-112, 60, and 122 yielded higher hEPO concentrations than MC3 formulations at 6 hr time point.

Table 12 compares the nanoparticle compositions including compounds according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) to the compositions including MC3 on the basis of expression and flux levels. As is evident in Table 12, both Compounds 6 and 18 outperform MC3 in both hEPO expression and average total flux. Thus, these lipids may be useful in nanoparticle composition therapeutics.

Example 11: Expression of hEPO Induced by Sample Formulations in Rat and Residual Lipid Levels in the Liver
[1450]
The expression of hEPO and cytokine induction in rats intravenously administered a nanoparticle composition at a dose of 2.0 mpk was measured at 6 h.
[1451]
At 48 h liver tissue was harvested for lipid quantification. To pre-weighed tissues, Milli-Q water was added (900 μL water per 100 mg tissue). Tissues were homogenized using an Omni probe homogenizer until uniform. 50 μL of samples and matrix calibration standards were aliquoted into a 96-well plate. 50 μL of blank matrix for matrix blanks and control blanks were aliquoted. 400 μL IS spiking solution were manually added to all samples except matrix blanks. 400 μL of 50:50 ACN:IPA were manually added to matrix blanks. The plate was covered and the samples vortexed and centrifuged for 5 minutes at >3000 rpm. 200 μL of the samples were transferred into a clean 96-well plate for analysis. Samples were analyzed on a Waters Acquity UPLC using a Higgins Analytical Clipeus C8 column (5 μM, 30×2.1 mm) and a gradient of either 70-95% or 60-95% (Mobile Phase A: 5 mM ammonium formate in 50:50:1 H2O:MeOH:formic acid; Mobile Phase B: 5 mM ammonium formate in 100:1 MeOH:formic acid) over 1.3 min at 1.2 mL/min (column temperature 55° C.). Detection was based on electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode using a Sciex API5500 Mass Spectrometer.

Example 14: Optimization of Lipid:Therapeutic Agent Ratios
[1457]
The relative amounts of lipid component and therapeutic and/or prophylactic in a nanoparticle composition can be optimized according to considerations of efficacy and tolerability. For compositions including an RNA as a therapeutic and/or prophylactic, the N:P ratio can serve as a useful metric.
[1458]
As the N:P ratio of a nanoparticle composition controls both expression and tolerability, nanoparticle compositions with low N:P ratios and strong expression are desirable. N:P ratios vary according to the ratio of lipids to RNA in a nanoparticle composition. Thus, the wt/wt ratio of total lipid to RNA is varied between 10:1, 15:1, 20:1, 32:1, 40:1, 50:1, and 60:1 for a lipid formulation including about 50 mol % of a compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe), about 10 mol % phospholipid (e.g., DOPE or DSPC), about 38.5 mol % structural lipid (e.g., cholesterol), and about 1.5 mol % PEG lipid (e.g., PEG-DMG). N:P ratios are calculated for each nanoparticle composition assuming a single protonated nitrogen atom. The encapsulation efficiency (EE), size, and polydispersity index of each composition are also measured.
[1459]
Generally, compositions with higher total lipid:RNA ratios yield smaller particles with higher encapsulation efficiencies, both of which are desirable. However, the N:P ratio for such formulations generally exceeds 4. Current standards in the art such as the MC3 formulation described above have N:P ratios of 5.67. Thus, a balance between the N:P ratio, size, and encapsulation efficiency should be struck.
[1460]
In order to explore the efficacy of nanoparticle compositions with different N:P ratios, the expression of luciferase (Luc) or human erythropoietin (hEPO) in mice after low (0.05 mg/kg) or high (0.5 mg/kg) doses of intravenously administered nanoparticle compositions is examined. The concentration of Luc or hEPO expressed is measured 3, 6, and/or 24 hours after administration.
Example 15: Optimization of Content of a Compound According to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe)
[1461]
As smaller particles with higher encapsulation efficiencies are generally desirable, the relative amounts of various elements in lipid components of nanoparticle compositions are optimized according to these parameters.
[1462]
A compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) is selected for optimization. The relative amount of the compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) is varied between 30 mol % and 60 mol % in compositions including DOPE or DSPC as phospholipids to determine the optimal amount of the compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) in the formulations. Formulations are prepared using a standardized process with a water to ethanol ratio in the lipid-mRNA solution of 3:1 and a rate of injection of the lipid solution into the mRNA solution of 12 mL/min on a NanoAssemblr microfluidic based system. This method induces nano-precipitation and particle formation. Alternative processes including, but not limited to, T-junction or direct injection, may also be used to achieve the same nano-precipitation.
[1463]
Formulations producing the smallest particles with the highest encapsulation efficiencies are generally preferred, however larger or smaller particle sizes may be desirable based on a given application (e.g., based on the fenestration size of a target organ). Compositions are also evaluated for their Luc or hEPO expression levels and cytokine profiles.
Example 16: Optimization of Phospholipid
[1464]
The relative amount of phospholipid in a lipid component of a nanoparticle composition is varied to further optimize the formulation. A compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) is selected for use in the nanoparticle composition and DOPE and DSPC are selected as phospholipids. Additional phospholipids can also be evaluated. Nanoparticle compositions are prepared with the relative phospholipid content varying between 0 mol % and 30 mol %. Compositions are evaluated for their size, encapsulation efficiency, Luc or hEPO expression levels, and cytokine profiles.
Example 17: Optimization of Structural Lipid
[1465]
The relative amount of structural lipid in a lipid component of a nanoparticle composition is varied to further optimize the formulation. A compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) is selected for use in the nanoparticle composition and cholesterol is selected as a structural lipid. Additional structural lipids can also be evaluated. Nanoparticle compositions are prepared with the relative structural lipid content varying between 18.5 mol % and 48.5 mol %. Compositions are evaluated for their size, encapsulation efficiency, Luc or hEPO expression levels, and cytokine profiles.
Example 18: Optimization of PEG Lipid
[1466]
The relative amount of PEG lipid in a lipid component of a nanoparticle composition is varied to further optimize the formulation. A compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe) is selected for use in the nanoparticle composition and PEG-DMG is selected as a PEG lipid. Additional PEG lipids can also be evaluated. Nanoparticle compositions are prepared with the relative PEG lipid content varying between 0 mol % and 10 mol %. Compositions are evaluated for their size, encapsulation efficiency, Luc or hEPO expression levels, and cytokine profiles.

Example 19: Optimization of Particle Sizes
[1468]
The fenestration sizes for different bodily organs often vary; for example, the kidney is known to have a smaller fenestration size than the liver. Thus, targeting delivery of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic (e.g., specifically delivering) to a particular organ or group of organs may require the administration of nanoparticle compositions with different particle sizes. In order to investigate this effect, nanoparticle compositions with formulations such as those included in Table 23 are prepared with a variety of particle sizes using a Nanoassemblr instrument. Nanoparticle compositions include an RNA encoding Luc. Each differently sized nanoparticle composition is subsequently administered to mice to evaluate the effect of particle size on delivery selectivity. Luc expression in two or more organs or groups of organs can be measured using bioluminescence to evaluate the relative expression in each organ.
Example 20: Administration Following Pretreatment
[1469]
Administration of nanoparticle compositions to subjects can result in inflammation, infusion related reactions, and other undesirable effects indicative of low tolerability. These effects can be attributed to undesirable immunoactivity.
[1470]
In order to combat negative effects, nanoparticle compositions are co-administered with one or more substances (e.g., co-medications or additional therapeutic and/or prophylactics) to subjects. Potentially useful additional therapeutic and/or prophylactics include steroids (e.g., corticosteroids), anti-histamines, H1 receptor blockers, H2 receptor blockers, anti-inflammatory compounds, statins, BTK inhibitors, S1P1 agonists, glucocorticoid receptor modulators (GRMs), and estradiols. Non-human primates are pretreated with one or more additional therapeutic agents selected from dexamethasone and acetaminophen. The additional therapeutic agent is administered either 24 hours, 1 hour, or both 24 hours and 1 hour before administration of a nanoparticle composition. Sample protocol are summarized in Table 24. Cytokine profiles, inflammation, and other parameters are measured and compared to evaluate the effectiveness of pretreatment.

[1471]
For example, a useful therapeutic treatment course may involve administering an additional therapeutic and/or prophylactic both the day before and the day of (one hour prior) to administration of a nanoparticle composition at a dose level of 1.3 mpk. Additional therapeutic and/or prophylactics can be formulated for delivery by a variety of different routes. For example, dexamethasone may be delivered orally. In general, additional therapeutic and/or prophylactics are administered at clinically approved or typical dosage levels.
Example 21: Administration to Non-Human Primates
[1472]
The tolerability and efficacy of nanoparticle compositions to non-human primates was evaluated in Cynomolgus monkeys. Monkeys were administered an optimized nanoparticle composition including an mRNA encoding hEPO once weekly for four weeks. The levels of hEPO protein, mRNA, and cytokine profiles were measured using ELISA-based techniques before and 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours after each administration.
[1473]
The effects of pretreatment to non-human primates were evaluated using a standard MC3 formulation including an mRNA encoding hEPO. The study design is summarized in Table 25. Male monkeys were administered the nanoparticle composition once weekly for four weeks at a dose rate of 5 ml/kg/h and were pretreated with either methotrexate or dexamethasone.

[1474]
Results of the pretreatment study are shown in FIG. 1. As shown, in the absence of any pretreatment, maximal expression levels decreased nearly 70% over the course of the study. Methotrexate did not confer any particular beneficial effect. However, pre-administration of dexamethasone resulted in increased protein expression compared to treatment courses not involving pretreatment. Notably, minimal decrease in plasma/serum protein expression was observed over time for animals pretreated with dexamethasone. These results suggest that pretreatment of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone improves the tolerability and efficacy of nanoparticle compositions containing, for example, a compound according to Formula (I), (IA), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId) or (IIe).
[1475]
The tolerability and efficacy of nanoparticle compositions to non-human primates was also investigated using a sample formulation including Compound 18. The formulation was prepared according to the standard MC3 formulation described above and included an hEPO mRNA. Primates were administered a single dose of 0.05 (Group 1), 0.3 (Group 2), or 1.0 (Group 3) mpk via intravenous infusion for 60 minutes. Three primates were administered each dose. Expression of hEPO was measured prior to dosing and at 2, 6, 24, 48, and 96 hours post-treatment (Table 26). Pharmacokinetic parameters including Tmax, Cmax, and the AUC were also determined and are presented in Table 27. Table 28 includes levels of indicators of complement activation, while Table 29 includes cytokine induction data.

In general, the formulation was tolerated similarly to the MC3 formulation with dose-response effects. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased in the high dose group on Day 2 and returned to baseline by Day 5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels did not increase, however. In general, lower doses were better tolerated. High doses induced body temperature elevation and hunched posture, which is similar to the behavior observed for primates administered higher doses of MC3 formulations. White blood cell counts were slightly elevated in animals in the high dose group, however all groups showed a marked increase in reticulocyte counts on Day 5, indicating a strong pharmacological response. Complement activation and cytokine release (IL-6 and MCP-1) were dose-related and reversible within 24 hours for the low and mid-dose groups and by Day 5 in the high dose group. hEPO levels were higher than those measured upon administration of comparable doses of MC3 formulations to non-human primates.
Example 22: Administration to Non-Human Primates
[1477]
The tolerability and efficacy of nanoparticle compositions to non-human primates was also investigated using sample formulations including Compounds 18, 25, 26, and 48 and MC3 to determine if these compounds are differentiated in terms of protein expression. The formulations were prepared according to the standard MC3 formulation described above and included an hEPO mRNA. Table 30 includes details of the compositions tested, while Table 31 summarizes the relative expression of Luc and hEPO mRNA in mice and rats. Expression was measured 6 hours after administration.

[1480]
Results of hEPO expression studies were validated using a standard MC3 formulation and a nanoparticle composition containing Compound 18 including an mRNA encoding an anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody. Cynomolgus monkeys were administered a single dose of 0.1 mpk or 0.3 mpk of a nanoparticle composition containing Compound 18 (see Table 33; prepared according to Example 2) including an mRNA encoding anti-HA antibody via intravenous infusion for 60 minutes.

[1482]
A five times higher protein expression was observed with the nanoparticle composition containing Compound 18 versus the MC3 counterpart, and a clear dose response between 0.1 and 0.3 mpk with Compound 18 was found (e.g., 0.3 mpk AUC is about three times of that from 0.1 mpk dose).
Example 24: Methods of Treating Diseases and Disorders
[1483]
A nanoparticle composition formulation having high tolerability (e.g., provoking a low immune response) and efficacy (e.g., facilitating efficient and effective encapsulation of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic and delivery of the agent to a desired target) is selected for use. A therapeutic and/or prophylactic for formulation with the nanoparticle composition is selected for use based on the condition of a subject. For example, an mRNA encoding a vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) may be selected to promote angiogenesis to treat atherosclerotic renovascular disease, while an siRNA capable of knocking down apolipoprotein B (apoB) may be selected to treat a metabolic disease or disorder such as dyslipidemia.
[1484]
A subject in need of treatment is pretreated with a small dose of dexamethasone one or more hours prior to treatment with the nanoparticle composition. The nanoparticle composition is preferably administered to the subject intravenously, however intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous, intranasal, or inhalation administration routes are also acceptable. Treatment is provided in a dose of about 0.001 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of therapeutic and/or prophylactic and is repeated daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly according to needs of the subject.
