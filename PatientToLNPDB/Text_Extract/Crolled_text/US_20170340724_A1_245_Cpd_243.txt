BACKGROUND
[0002]
Insects such as mosquitoes cause significant human suffering by transmission of infectious disease to humans. The infections carried by mosquitoes afflict humans, as well as companion animals such as dogs and horses. Infectious agents transmitted by mosquitos cause illnesses such as encephalitis, Chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile fever, malaria, and Dengue. The transmission of diseases associated with mosquito bites can be interrupted by killing the mosquitoes, isolating infected people from all mosquitoes while they are infectious or vaccinating the exposed population.
[0003]
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccination is one technique used to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses to foreign antigens, such as Malaria, JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and YFV antigens. The direct injection of genetically engineered DNA (e.g., naked plasmid DNA) into a living host results in a small number of its cells directly producing an antigen, resulting in a protective immunological response. With this technique, however, comes potential problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, which could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes.
SUMMARY
[0004]
Provided herein are ribonucleic acid (RNA) vaccines that build on the knowledge that RNA (e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA)) can safely direct the body's cellular machinery to produce nearly any protein of interest, from native proteins to antibodies and other entirely novel protein constructs that can have therapeutic activity inside and outside of cells. The RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines of the present disclosure may be used to induce a balanced immune response against Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV), Sindbis Virus (SINV), Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Zika Virus (ZIKV) and/or Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), comprising both cellular and humoral immunity, without risking the possibility of insertional mutagenesis, for example. Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV are referred to herein as “tropical diseases.” Thus, the terms “tropical disease vaccines” and “Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV” encompass Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale) RNA vaccines, JEV RNA vaccines, WNV RNA vaccines, EEEV RNA vaccines, SINV RNA vaccines, CHIKV RNA vaccines, DENV RNA vaccines, ZIKV RNA vaccines, YFV RNA vaccines, and combination vaccines comprising at least two (e.g., at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9) of any of the Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale) RNA vaccines, JEV RNA vaccines, WNV RNA vaccines, EEEV RNA vaccines, SINV RNA vaccines, CHIKV RNA vaccines, DENV RNA vaccines, ZIKV RNA vaccines, and YFV RNA vaccines.
[0005]
The RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines may be utilized in various settings depending on the prevalence of the infection or the degree or level of unmet medical need. The RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines may be utilized to treat and/or prevent Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV of various genotypes, strains, and isolates. The RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines have superior properties in that they produce much larger antibody titers and responses earlier than commercially available anti-viral therapeutic treatments. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines, as mRNA polynucleotides, are better designed to produce the appropriate protein conformation upon translation, as the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines co-opt natural cellular machinery. Unlike traditional vaccines, which are manufactured ex vivo and may trigger unwanted cellular responses, RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines are presented to the cellular system in a more native fashion.
[0006]
Surprisingly, it has been shown that efficacy of mRNA vaccines can be significantly enhanced when combined with a flagellin adjuvant, in particular, when one or more antigen-encoding mRNA is combined with an mRNA encoding flagellin. RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines combined with the flagellin adjuvant (e.g., mRNA-encoded flagellin adjuvant) have superior properties in that they may produce much larger antibody titers and produce responses earlier than commercially available vaccine formulations.
[0007]
Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines that include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding at least one antigenic polypeptide or an immunogenic fragment thereof (e.g., an immunogenic fragment capable of inducing an immune response to the antigenic polypeptide) and at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA polynucleotide) having an open reading frame encoding a flagellin adjuvant.

Yellow Fever Virus (YFV)
[0038]
Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The “yellow” in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients. Symptoms of yellow fever include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. A small proportion of patients who contract the virus develop severe symptoms and approximately half of those die within 7 to 10 days. Yellow fever virus (YFV) is endemic in tropical areas of Africa and Central and South America. Large epidemics of yellow fever occur when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with high mosquito density and where most people have little or no immunity, due to lack of vaccination. In these conditions, infected mosquitoes transmit the virus from person to person. Since the launch of the Yellow Fever Initiative in 2006, significant progress in combating the disease has been made in West Africa and more than 105 million people have been vaccinated in mass campaigns using an attenuated live vaccine. Nonetheless, this vaccine can cause yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease as well as yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease, each of which can be fatal.

Dengue Virus (DENV)
[0068]
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti/Aedes albopictus) member of the family Flaviviridae (positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus). Dengue virus is a positive-sense RNA virus of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, which also includes West Nile virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and Japanese Encephalitis virus. It is transmitted to humans through Stegomyia aegypti (formerly Aedes) mosquito vectors and is mainly found in the tropical and semitropical areas of the world, where it is endemic in Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The incidence of infections has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years (WHO, Dengue: Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control (2009)) and Dengue virus is the second most common tropical infectious disease worldwide after malaria.
[0069]
Severe disease is most commonly observed in secondary, heterologous DENV infections. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection has been proposed as the primary mechanism of dengue immunopathogenesis. The potential risk of immune enhancement of infection and disease underscores the importance of developing dengue vaccines which produce balanced, long-lasting immunity to at least DENV 1-4, if not all five of the DENV serotypes. While several dengue vaccines are in development, none have been officially licensed and/or approved to date.
[0070]
In view of the lack of Dengue virus (DENV) vaccines, there is a significant need for a vaccine that would be safe and effective in all patient populations to prevent and/or to treat DENV infection, including those individuals at risk for secondary, heterotypic infections (those with more than one circulating serotype).

[0127]
In some embodiments, a method of producing an antigen-specific immune response comprises administering to a subject a single dose (no booster dose) of a RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine is a Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P.

In some embodiments, the subjects exhibit a seroconversion rate of at least 80% (e.g., at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95%) following the first dose or the second (booster) dose of the vaccine. Seroconversion is the time period during which a specific antibody develops and becomes detectable in the blood. After seroconversion has occurred, a virus can be detected in blood tests for the antibody. During an infection or immunization, antigens enter the blood, and the immune system begins to produce antibodies in response. Before seroconversion, the antigen itself may or may not be detectable, but antibodies are considered absent. During seroconversion, antibodies are present but not yet detectable. Any time after seroconversion, the antibodies can be detected in the blood, indicating a prior or current infection.
[0130]
In some embodiments, a RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine is administered to a subject by intradermal, intramuscular injection, or by intranasal administration.

In some embodiments, the anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in the subject is increased 2-10 times relative to a control.
[0133]
In some embodiments, the control is an anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in a subject who has not been administered a RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the control is an anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in a subject who has been administered a live attenuated or inactivated Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P.

[0137]
In some embodiments, the effective amount is a total dose of 25 μg to 1000 μg, or 50 μg to 1000 μg. In some embodiments, the effective amount is a total dose of 100 μg.

[0139]
Vaccine efficacy may be assessed using standard analyses (see, e.g., Weinberg et al., J Infect Dis. 2010 Jun. 1; 201(11):1607-10). For example, vaccine efficacy may be measured by double-blind, randomized, clinical controlled trials. Vaccine efficacy may be expressed as a proportionate reduction in disease attack rate (AR) between the unvaccinated (ARU) and vaccinated (ARV) study cohorts and can be calculated from the relative risk (RR) of disease among the vaccinated group with use of the following formulas:

Efficacy=(ARU−ARV)/ARU×100; and

Efficacy=(1−RR)×100.
[0140]
Likewise, vaccine effectiveness may be assessed using standard analyses (see, e.g., Weinberg et al., J Infect Dis. 2010 Jun. 1; 201(11):1607-10). Vaccine effectiveness is an assessment of how a vaccine (which may have already proven to have high vaccine efficacy) reduces disease in a population. This measure can assess the net balance of benefits and adverse effects of a vaccination program, not just the vaccine itself, under natural field conditions rather than in a controlled clinical trial. Vaccine effectiveness is proportional to vaccine efficacy (potency) but is also affected by how well target groups in the population are immunized, as well as by other non-vaccine-related factors that influence the ‘real-world’ outcomes of hospitalizations, ambulatory visits, or costs. For example, a retrospective case control analysis may be used, in which the rates of vaccination among a set of infected cases and appropriate controls are compared. Vaccine effectiveness may be expressed as a rate difference, with use of the odds ratio (OR) for developing infection despite vaccination:

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0220]
Vaccines containing antigens from more than one pathogenic organism within a single dose are referred to as “multivalent” or “combination” vaccines. While various combination vaccines have been approved for human use in several countries, including trivalent vaccines for protecting against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (“DTP” vaccines) and trivalent vaccines for protecting against measles, mumps and rubella (“MMR” vaccines), combination vaccines are more complex and are associated with more problems than monovalent vaccines. For instance, current combination vaccines can include relatively high amounts of aluminum salts as adjuvants which causes concern to some patients despite empirical safety studies. Additionally, the well-documented phenomenon of antigenic competition (or interference) complicates the development of multi-component vaccines. Antigenic interference refers to the observation that administering multiple antigens often results in a diminished response to certain antigens relative to the immune response observed when such antigens are administered individually. The combination RNA vaccines of the invention can be designed to encode two, three, four, five or more, antigens against multiple pathogenic organisms, while avoiding a number of the problems associated with traditional combination vaccines.
[0221]
Travelers facing a particular geographic viral threat would also benefit from vaccination with a combination vaccine of the invention. The traveler's vaccine may be tailored based on the prevalence of particular viral diseases in the destination location. For instance a combination vaccine including WNV, SINV, VEEV, and EEEV would be particularly beneficial.
[0222]
Embodiments of the present disclosure provide RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines that are useful for vaccinating against multiple pathogens. The combination vaccines of the present disclosure encode antigens from multiple pathogens (e.g., bacteria, arboviruses, alphaviruses and flaviviruses), including but not limited to Plasmodium (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEEV), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV), Sindbis Virus (SINV), Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Zika Virus (ZIKV) and/or Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) antigenic polypeptide.
[0223]
Thus, the present disclosure provides, in some embodiments, vaccines that comprise RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides encoding a Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide. The present disclosure also provides, in some embodiments, combination vaccines that comprise at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide encoding at least two antigenic polypeptides selected from Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and YFV antigenic polypeptides. Also provided herein are methods of administering the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines, methods of producing the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines, compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) comprising the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines, and nucleic acids (e.g., DNA) encoding the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines. In some embodiments, a RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine comprises an adjuvant, such as a flagellin adjuvant, as provided herein.
[0224]
The RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines (e.g., Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV RNA vaccines), in some embodiments, may be used to induce a balanced immune response, comprising both cellular and humoral immunity, without many of the risks associated with DNA vaccination.

Malaria
[0226]
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by protozoan parasites from the Plasmodium family. Anopheles mosquitoes transmit Malaria, and they must have been infected through a previous blood meal taken from an infected person. When a mosquito bites an infected person, a small amount of blood is taken in and contains microscopic Malaria parasites. There are four main types of Malaria which infect humans: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and P. ovale. Falciparum Malaria is the most deadly type. Many Malaria parasites are now immune to the most common drugs used to treat the disease.
[0227]
Embodiments of the present disclosure provide RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines that include polynucleotide encoding a Plasmodium antigen. Malaria parasites are microorganisms that belong to the genus Plasmodium. There are more than 100 species of Plasmodium, which can infect many animal species such as reptiles, birds, and various mammals Four species of Plasmodium have long been recognized to infect humans in nature, including P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. Malariae and P. ovale. In addition, there is one species that naturally infects macaques which has recently been recognized to be a cause of zoonotic Malaria in humans.
[0228]
Malaria RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines, as provided herein may be used to induce a balanced immune response, comprising both cellular and humoral immunity, without many of the risks associated with DNA vaccination.
[0229]
P. falciparum infects humans and is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical areas. It is estimated that every year approximately 1 million people are killed by P. falciparum, especially in Africa where this species predominates. P. falciparum can cause severe Malaria because it multiples rapidly in the blood, and can thus cause severe blood loss (anemia). In addition, the infected parasites can clog small blood vessels. When this occurs in the brain, cerebral Malaria results, a complication that can be fatal. Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide Malaria vaccines that include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding at least one P. falciparum antigenic polypeptide or an immunogenic fragment thereof (e.g., an immunogenic fragment capable of raising an immune response to P. falciparum).
[0230]
P. vivax infects humans and is found mostly in Asia, Latin America, and in some parts of Africa. Because of the population densities, especially in Asia, it is probably the most prevalent human Malaria parasite. P. vivax (as well as P. ovale) has dormant liver stages (“hypnozoites”) that can activate and invade the blood (“relapse”) several months or years after the infecting mosquito bite. Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide Malaria vaccines that include at least RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding at least one P. vivax antigenic polypeptide or an immunogenic fragment thereof (e.g., an immunogenic fragment capable of raising an immune response to P. vivax).
[0231]
P. ovale infects humans and is found mostly in Africa (especially West Africa) and the islands of the western Pacific. It is biologically and morphologically very similar to P. vivax. However, differently from P. vivax, it can infect individuals who are negative for the Duffy blood group, which is the case for many residents of sub-Saharan Africa. This explains the greater prevalence of P. ovale (rather than P. vivax) in most of Africa. Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide Malaria vaccines that include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding at least one P. ovale antigenic polypeptide or an immunogenic fragment thereof (e.g., an immunogenic fragment capable of raising an immune response to P. ovale).
[0232]
P. Malariae infects humans and is found worldwide. It is the only human Malaria parasite species that has a quartan cycle (three-day cycle). The three other species that infect human have a tertian, two-day cycle. If untreated, P. Malariae causes a long-lasting, chronic infection that in some cases can last a lifetime. In some chronically infected patients P. Malariae can cause serious complications such as the nephrotic syndrome. Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide Malaria vaccines that include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding at least one P. Malariae antigenic polypeptide or an immunogenic fragment thereof (e.g., an immunogenic fragment capable of raising an immune response to P. Malariae).
[0233]
P. knowlesi is found throughout Southeast Asia as a natural pathogen of long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques. It has recently been shown to be a significant cause of zoonotic Malaria in that region, particularly in Malaysia. P. knowlesi has a 24-hour replication cycle and so can rapidly progress from an uncomplicated to a severe infection; fatal cases have been reported.
[0234]
In some embodiments, an antigenic polypeptide is any antigen that is expressed on the sporozoite or other pre-erythrocytic stage of a Plasmodium parasite, such as the liver stage. For example, an antigenic polypeptide may be a circurnsporozoite (CS) protein, liver stage antigen-1 (LSA1) (see, e.g., WO2004/044167 and Cummings J F et al. Vaccine 2010; 28:5135-44, incorporated herein by reference), liver stage antigen-3 (LSA-3) (see, e.g., EP 0 570 489 and EP 0 833 917, incorporated herein by reference), Pfs 16 kD (see, e.g., WO 91/18922 and EP 597 843), Exported antigen-1 (Exp-1) (described for example in Meraldi et al. Parasite Immunol 2002; 24(3):141, incorporated herein by reference), sporozoite-threonine-asparagine-rich protein (STARP), sporozoite and liver stage antigen (SALSA), thrombospondin related anonymous protein (TRAP) (see, e.g., WO 90/01496, WO 91/11516 and WO 92/11868, incorporated herein by reference) and apical merozoite antigen-1 (AMA1) (see, e.g., EP 0 372 019 and Remargue E J et al. Trends in Parasitology 2007; 24(2):74-84, incorporated herein by reference) which has recently been shown to be present at the liver stage (in addition to the erythrocytic stage), and merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1) (see, e.g., Reed Z H et al. Vaccine 2009; 27:1651-60, incorporated herein by reference). An antigenic polypeptide may be the entire protein, an immunogenic fragment thereof, or a derivative thereof of any of the foregoing antigens. Immunogenic fragments of Malaria antigens are known, including, for example, the ectodomain from AMA1 (see, e.g., WO 02/077195, incorporated herein by reference). Derivatives include, for example, fusions with other proteins that may be Malaria proteins or non-Malaria proteins, such as HBsAg. Derivatives of the present disclosure are capable of raising an immune response against the native antigen.
[0235]
The sporozoite stage of Plasmodium (e.g., P. falciparum or P. vivax) is a potential target of a Malaria vaccine. The major surface protein of the sporozoite is circumsporozoite protein (CS protein). The Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein (CS) is expressed during the sporozoite and early liver stages of parasitic infection. This protein is involved in the adhesion of the sporozoite to the hepatocyte and invasion of the hepatocyte. Anti-CS antibodies inhibit parasite invasion and are also associated with a reduced risk of clinical Malaria in some studies. Antibodies raised through immunization with only the conserved Asparagine-Alanine-Asparagine-Proline (NAND) amino acid repeat sequence, the immunodominant B-cell epitope from P. falciparum CS, are capable of blocking sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes.
[0236]
CS protein has been cloned, expressed and sequenced for a variety of strains, for example for P. falciparum the NF54 strain, clone 3D7 (Caspers et al. Parasitol 1989; 35:185-190, incorporated herein by reference). The protein from strain 3D7 has a central immunodominant repeat region comprising a tetrapeptide Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro (SEQ ID NO: 434) repeated 40 times and interspersed with four minor repeats of the tetrapeptide Asn-Val-Asp-Pro (SEQ ID NO: 435). In other strains, the number of major and minor repeats as well as their relative position varies. This central portion is flanked by an N and C terminal portion composed of non-repetitive amino acid sequences designated as the repeatless portion of the CS protein.
[0237]
Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide Malaria vaccines that include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding Plasmodium CS protein or an immunogenic fragment thereof (e.g., an immunogenic fragment capable of raising an immune response to Plasmodium).
[0238]
Liver Stage Antigen-1 (LSA1), expressed during Plasmodium falciparum hepatic schizogony is highly conserved, is abundantly expressed from early through late schizogony, presumably allowing time for both circulating and memory-recalled effector cells to infiltrate the liver and exert their effector function, and it is possible that high titer antibody could act upon the cloud of flocculent liver stage antigen enveloping hepatic merozoites to impede the latter's emergence and subsequent invasion of erythrocytes. LSA1 is a 230 kDa protein, with a large central repeat region (over 80 repeats of 17 amino acids each) flanked by two highly conserved N- and C-terminal regions, known to contain B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes.
[0239]
Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide Malaria vaccines that include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding Plasmodium LSA1 or an immunogenic fragment thereof (e.g., an immunogenic fragment capable of raising an immune response to Plasmodium). In some embodiments, Malaria vaccines include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a recombinant protein with full-length C- and N-terminal flanking domains and two of the 17 amino acid repeats from the central repeat region, referred to as “LSA-NRC.”
[0240]
Present on the surface of all known Plasmodium spp., merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) is a polypeptide of 190-230 kDa that undergoes processing during schizont rupture to produce at least four distinct fragments (83, 28-30, 38-45 and 42 kDa). Further cleavage of the carboxy-terminal 42-kDa (MSP142) fragment yields a 19-kDa fragment (MSP119), in a process that appears to be critical for merozoite invasion. Both MSP142 and MSP119 regions of P. falciparum are encompassed by the present disclosure.
[0241]
Thus, in some embodiments, Malaria vaccines include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding Plasmodium MSP1 or an immunogenic fragment thereof (e.g., an immunogenic fragment capable of raising an immune response to Plasmodium).
[0242]
In some embodiments, Malaria vaccines include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding Plasmodium MSP1, MSP3 and AMA1.
[0243]
Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is a micronemal protein of apicomplexan parasites that appears to be essential during the invasion of host cells. Immune responses to Plasmodium AMA1 can have parasite-inhibitory effects, both as measured in vitro and in animal challenge models. First identified as an invariant Plasmodium knowlesi merozoite surface antigen, AMA1 is believed to be unique to apicomplexan and derives from a single essential gene present in all Plasmodium species.
[0244]
Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide Malaria vaccines that include at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding Plasmodium AMA1 or an immunogenic fragment thereof (e.g., an immunogenic fragment capable of raising an immune response to Plasmodium).
Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV)
[0245]
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is a common cause of encephalitis in Asia. Japanese encephalitis (JE) occurs throughout most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific. Among an estimated 35,000-50,000 annual cases, approximately 20%-30% of patients die, and 30%-50% of survivors have neurologic or psychiatric sequelae. In endemic countries, JE is primarily a disease of children. However, travel-associated JE, although rare, can occur in a wide portion of the population. JEV is transmitted in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and amplifying vertebrate hosts, primarily pigs and wading birds. JEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, primarily in rural agricultural areas. In most temperate areas of Asia, JEV transmission is seasonal, and substantial epidemics can occur.
[0246]
Vaccines available for use against JEV infection include live virus inactivated by such methods as formalin treatment, as well as attenuated virus (Tsai et al., in Vaccines (Plotkin, ed.) W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, Pa., 1994, pp. 671-713). Whole virus vaccines, although effective, do have certain problems and/or disadvantages. The viruses are cultivated in mouse brain or in cell culture using mammalian cells as the host. Such culture methods are cumbersome and expensive.
[0247]
Embodiments of the present disclosure provide RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines that include polynucleotide encoding a JEV antigen. JEV is a small-enveloped virus with a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA genome, consisting of a single open reading frame that codes for a large polyprotein which is co- and post-translationally cleaved into three structural (capsid, C; pre-membrane, prM; and envelope, E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). The RNA genome of JEV has a type I cap structure at its 5′-terminus but lacks a poly(A) tail at its 3′ terminus. E protein is involved in a number of important functions related to virus infection such as receptor binding and membrane fusion. E protein has been used to raise antibodies that neutralize virus activity in vitro as well as in vivo. Additionally, sub-viral particles consisting of only the prM and the E proteins were highly effective in generating protective immune response in mice against JEV. The ability of various JEV structural and non-structural proteins to produce an immune response has been examined. (Chen, H. W., et al., 1999. J. Virol. 73:10137-10145.) In view of these and other studies it has been concluded that the E protein is an important protein for inducing protective immunity against JEV.
[0248]
The full-length E protein is membrane anchored Immunogenic fragments of the E protein can be generated by removing the anchor signal. For instance, truncated Ea protein wherein a 102-amino acid hydrophobic sequence has been removed from the C-terminus of the protein to generate a 398-amino acid Es protein for immunogenic antigenic fragments. Other immunogenic fragments include a secretory form of E protein, as opposed to the anchored protein. Thus immunogenic fragments include the truncated E protein and the secretory envelope protein (Es) of JEV. JEV antigens may also include one or more non-structural proteins selected from NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5.
[0249]
Since the envelope (most external portion of a JEV particle) is the first to encounter target cells, the present disclosure encompasses antigenic polypeptides associated with the envelope as immunogenic agents. In brief, surface and membrane proteins E, Es, capsid and prM—as single antigens or in combination with or without adjuvants may be used as JEV vaccine antigens.
[0250]
In some embodiments, JEV vaccines comprise RNA (e.g., mRNA) encoding JEV E antigenic polypeptides or immunogenic fragments thereof.
[0251]
In some embodiments, JEV vaccines comprise RNA (e.g., mRNA) encoding JEV Es antigenic polypeptides or immunogenic fragments thereof.

[0259]
In some embodiments, JEV vaccines comprise RNA (e.g., mRNA) encoding JEV antigenic polypeptides having at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identity with JEV NS1 protein and has viral replication and pathogenicity activity.
[0260]
JEV RNA vaccines, as provided herein may be used to induce a balanced immune response, comprising both cellular and humoral immunity, without many of the risks associated with DNA vaccination.
West Nile Virus (WNV), Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEEV), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV), and Sindbis Virus (SINV)
[0261]
WNV was first isolated in the West Nile region of Uganda, Africa, and belongs to the Flaviviridae family falvivirus genus. The structure of virus particles consists of a spherical structure wherein a capsid protein (C protein) is bonded to one (+) chain RNA virus gene, and a lipid bilayer membrane surrounding the spherical structure. The lipid membrane includes two kinds of proteins: envelope protein (E protein) and membrane protein (M protein). M protein is produced as a precursor prM protein and cleaved with a protease called furin to become a mature protein. West Nile virus (WNV) is an important mosquito transmitted virus which is now native to the U.S.
[0262]
West Nile fever is a systemic acute fever disease caused by infection with WNV. Occasionally, the virus invades and grows in the central nervous system to cause lethal brain meningitis. WNV is widely distributed in Africa, Middle East, part of Europe, Russia, India, and Indonesia. The virus is maintained and propagated by an infection ring. The West Nile fever virus is transmitted to birds and mammals by the bites of certain mosquitoes (e.g., Culex, Aedes, Anopheles). Direct transmission may happen from WNV infected subject to healthy subject by oral transmission (prey and transmission through colostrum) and blood/organ vectored transmission. Humans, horses and domestic animals are hosts. Recently, WNV invaded and was indigenized in the US and has expanded since then. A prevalent US strain is West Nile virus NY99-flamingo382-99 strain (Lanciotti, R. S. et al., Science, 286: 2333-2337, 1999) (GenBank Accession No. AF196835).
[0263]
The WNV antigens in the combination RNA vaccine may be derived from a particular WNV strain, such as NY99 or KEN-3829 or any other strain. Additional WNV strains are known in the art. West Nile virus antigens include the following proteins and polyproteins: C (capsid), E (envelope), M (membrane), prM (Pre-membrane), NS2A, NS2B, NS3 prM-E, M-E, prM-M, prM-M-E, and NS2A-NS2B-NS3.
[0264]
Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are members of the Alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae. The genus is comprised of at least 27 different arthropod-borne RNA viruses that are found throughout much of the world. The viruses normally circulate among avian or rodent hosts through the feeding activities of a variety of mosquitoes.

EEEV causes encephalitis in humans and equines in epidemic proportions. However, EEEV causes the most severe of the arboviral encephalitides in humans, with high mortality and severe neurological sequelae in survivors (Fields Virology, 4.sup.th Ed., Chapter 30 Alphaviruses, [2002] 917-962). The virus is known to be focally endemic along much of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of North America. It has also been found in southern Canada, the Caribbean, Central America, the eastern part of Mexico and in large sections of South America. Inland foci exist in the Great Lakes region and South Dakota in the U.S. as well as the Amazon Basin.
[0266]
The current EEEV vaccine for veterinary applications in the U.S. is a formalin-inactivated whole virus preparation derived from the PE-6 strain (Bartelloni, et al. [1970] Am J. Trop Med Hyg. 19:123-126; Marie, et al. [1970] Am J Trop Med Hyg. 19:119-122). Currently there is no human vaccine. The inactivated veterinary vaccine is poorly immunogenic, requires multiple inoculations with frequent boosters and generally results in immunity of short duration.
[0267]
EEEV, SINV, JEV, and CHIKV all have single-stranded, positive sense RNA genomes. A portion of the genome encodes the viral structural proteins Capsid, E3, E2, 6K, and E1, each of which are derived by proteolytic cleavage of the product of a single open reading frame. The nucleocapsid (C) protein possesses autoproteotytic activity which cleaves the C protein from the precursor protein soon after the ribosome transits the junction between the C and E3 protein coding sequence. Subsequently, the envelope glycoproteins E2 and E1 are derived by proteolytic cleavage in association with intracellular membranes and form heterodimers. E2 initially appears in the infected cell as the precursor protein PE2, which consists of E3 and E2. After extensive glycosylation and transit through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, E3 is cleaved from E2 by the furin protease. Subsequently, the E2/E1 complex is transported to the cell surface where it is incorporated into virus budding from the plasma membrane. The envelope proteins play an important role in attachment and fusion to cells.
[0268]
Sindbis Virus (SINV) is also a member of the Togaviridae family, in the alphavirus subfamily and is transmitted by mosquitoes. Sindbis fever is most common in South and East Africa, Egypt, Israel, Philippines and parts of Australia. The genome encodes four non-structural proteins at the 5′ end and the capsid and two envelope proteins at the 3′ end. The non-structural proteins are involved in genome replication and the production of new genomic RNA and a shorter sub-genomic RNA strand. The viruses assemble at the host cell surfaces and acquire their envelope through budding.
Yellow Fever Virus (YFV)
[0269]
Along with other viruses in the Flaviviridae family, Yellow fever virus is enveloped and icosahedral with a non-segmented, single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome. It is most closely related to the Sepik virus and is one of the two viruses in clade VIII. In 1927, Yellow fever virus was the first human virus to be isolated. It is found in tropical areas of Africa and South America. YFV is believed to have originated in Africa and spread to South America through slave trades in the 17th century. Since then, there have been Yellow fever outbreaks in the Americas, Africa and Europe. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and has been isolated from a number of species in the genus Aedes (e.g., Aedes aegypti, Aedes africanus or Aedes albopictus). Mosquitos of the genus Haemagogus and Sabethes can also serve as vectors. Studies show that the extrinsic incubation period in mosquitoes is about 10 days. Vertebrate hosts of the virus include monkeys and humans.
[0270]
Forty-seven African and South American countries are either endemic for, or have regions that are endemic from, Yellow fever. It is estimated that in 2013 alone, there were 84,000 to 170,000 severe cases of yellow fever and 29,000 to 60,000 deaths associated with Yellow fever.
[0271]
What is important is not only the number of cases but also the clinical manifestation of the cases. After YFV incubates in the body for about 6 days, symptoms including fever, muscle pain, backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting are observed. In most cases, these symptoms disappear after about 4 days. In a small percentage of patients, a more toxic phase of the disease is observed within 24 hours of recovering from the initial symptoms. In this toxic phase, patients develop high fever, jaundice, dark urine and abdominal pain with vomiting. Half of the patients that enter the toxic phase die within 10 days.
[0272]
In some embodiments, YFV vaccines comprise RNA (e.g., mRNA) encoding a YFV antigenic polypeptide having at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99% identity with YFV polyprotein and having YFV polyprotein activity, respectively. The YFV polyprotein is cleaved into capsid, precursor membrane, envelope, and non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5).
[0273]
A protein is considered to have YFV polyprotein activity if, for example, it facilitates the attachment of the viral envelope to host receptors, mediates internalization into the host cell, and aids in fusion of the virus membrane with the host's endosomal membrane.
Zika Virus (ZIKV)
[0274]
Along with other viruses in the Flaviviridae family, Zika virus is enveloped and icosahedral with a non-segmented, single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome. It is most closely related to the Spondweni virus and is one of the two viruses in the Spondweni virus clade. The virus was first isolated in 1947 from a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda, Africa and was isolated for the first time from humans in 1968 in Nigeria. From 1951 through 1981, evidence of human infection was reported from other African countries such as Uganda, Tanzania, Egypt, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone and Gabon, as well as in parts of Asia including India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and has been isolated from a number of species in the genus Aedes—Aedes aegypti, Aedes africanus, Aedes apicoargenteus, Aedes furcifer, Aedes luteocephalus and Aedes vitattus. Studies show that the extrinsic incubation period in mosquitoes is about 10 days. The vertebrate hosts of the virus include monkeys and humans.
[0275]
As of early 2016, the most widespread outbreak of Zika fever, caused by the Zika virus, is ongoing primarily in the Americas. The outbreak began in April 2015 in Brazil, and subsequently spread to other countries in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.
[0276]
The Zika virus was first linked with newborn microcephaly during the Brazil Zika virus outbreak. In 2015, there were 2,782 cases of microcephaly compared with 147 in 2014 and 167 in 2013. The Brazilian Health Ministry has reported 4783 cases of suspected microcephaly as of Jan. 30, 2016, an increase of more than 1000 cases from a week earlier. Confirmation of many of the recent cases is pending, and it is difficult to estimate how many cases went unreported before the recent awareness of the risk of virus infections.
[0277]
What is important is not only the number of cases but also the clinical manifestation of the cases. Brazil is seeing severe cases of microcephaly, which are more likely to be paired with greater developmental delays. Most of what is being reported out of Brazil is microcephaly with other associated abnormalities. The potential consequence of this is the fact that there are likely to be subclinical cases where the neurological sequelae will only become evident as the children grow.
[0278]
Zika virus has also been associated with an increase in a rare condition known as Guillain-Barré, where the infected individual becomes essentially paralyzed. During the Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia, of the 74 patients which had had Zika symptoms, 42 were diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome. In Brazil, 121 cases of neurological manifestations and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) were reported, all cases with a history of Zika-like symptoms.
[0279]
The design of preferred Zika vaccine mRNA constructs of the invention encode prME proteins from the Zika virus intended to produce significant immunogenicity. The open reading frame comprises a signal peptide (to optimize expression into the endoplasmic reticulum) followed by the Zika prME polyprotein sequence. The particular prME sequence used is from a Micronesian strain (2007) that most closely represents a consensus of contemporary strain prMEs. This construct has 99% prME sequence identity to the current Brazilian isolates.
[0280]
Within the Zika family, there is a high level of homology within the prME sequence (>90%) across all strains so far isolated. The high degree of homology is also preserved when comparing the original isolates from 1947 to the more contemporary strains circulating in Brazil in 2015, suggesting that there is “drift” occurring from the original isolates. Furthermore, attenuated virus preparations have provided cross-immunization to all other strains tested, including Latin American/Asian, and African. Overall, this data suggests that cross-protection of all Zika strains is possible with a vaccine based on prME. In fact, the prM/M and E proteins of ZIKV have a very high level (99%) of sequence conservation between the currently circulating Asiatic and Brazilian viral strains.
[0281]
The M and E proteins are on the surface of the viral particle. Neutralizing antibodies predominantly bind to the E protein, the preM/M protein functions as a chaperone for proper folding of E protein and prevent premature fusion of E protein within acidic compartments along the cellular secretory pathway.
[0282]
Described herein are examples of ZIKV vaccine designs comprising mRNA encoding the both prM/M and E proteins or E protein alone. In some embodiments, the mRNA encodes an artificial signal peptide fused to prM protein fused to E protein. In some embodiments, the mRNA encodes an artificial signal peptide fused to E protein.
[0283]
ZIKV vaccine constructs can encode the prME or E proteins from different strains, for example, Brazil_isolate_ZikaSPH2015 or ACD75819_Micronesia, having a signal peptide fused to the N-termini of the antigenic protein(s). In some embodiments, ZIKV vaccines comprise mRNAs encoding antigenic polypeptides having amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 156-222 or 469.
Dengue Virus (DENV)
[0284]
There is no specific treatment for DENV infection, and control of DENV by vaccination has proved elusive, in part, because the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not completely understood. While infection with one serotype confers lifelong homotypic immunity, it confers only short term (approximately three to six months) cross protection against heterotypic serotypes. Also, there is evidence that prior infection with one type can produce an antibody response that can intensify, or enhance, the course of disease during a subsequent infection with a different serotype. The possibility that vaccine components could elicit enhancing antibody responses, as opposed to protective responses, has been a major concern in designing and testing vaccines to protect against dengue infections. In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9-45 years of age living in endemic areas. Issues with the vaccine include (1) weak protection against DENV1 and DENV2 (<60% efficacy); (2) relative risk of dengue hospitalization among children <9 years old (7.5× higher than placebo); (3) immunogenicity not sustained after 1-2 years (implying the need for a 4th dose booster); and (4) lowest efficacy against DENV2, which often causes more severe conditions. This latter point is a major weakness with the Dengvaxia vaccine, signaling the need of a new, more effective vaccine effective against DENV2. Other tetravalent live-attenuated vaccines are under development in phase II and phase III clinical trials, and other vaccine candidates (based on subunit, DNA and purified inactivated virus platforms) are at earlier stages of clinical development, although the ability of these vaccine candidates to provide broad serotype protection has not been demonstrated.
[0285]
Embodiments of the present disclosure provide RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines that include at least one RNA polynucleotide encoding a Dengue virus (DENV) antigen. Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti/Aedes albopictus) member of the family Flaviviridae (positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus). The dengue virus genome encodes ten genes and is translated as a single polypeptide which is cut into ten proteins: the capsid, envelope, membrane, and nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, SN4A, NS4B, and NS5 proteins). The virus' main antigen is DENV envelope (E) protein, which is a component of the viral surface and is thought to facilitate the binding of the virus to cellular receptors (Heinz et al., Virology. 1983, 126:525). There are four similar but distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, and DENV-5), which result annually in an estimated 50-100 million cases of dengue fever and 500,000 cases of the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (Gubler et al., Adv Virus Res. 1999, 53:35-70). The four serotypes show immunological cross-reactivity, but are distinguishable in plaque reduction neutralization tests and by their respective monoclonal antibodies. The dengue virus E protein includes a serotype-specific antigenic determinant and determinants necessary for virus neutralization (Mason et al., J Gen Virol. 1990, 71:2107-2114).
[0286]
After inoculation, the dendritic cells become infected and travel to lymph nodes. Monocytes and macrophages are also targeted shortly thereafter. Generally, the infected individual will be protected against homotypic reinfection for life; however, the individual will only be protected against other serotypes for a few weeks or months (Sabin, Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1952, 1:30-50). In fact, DHF/DSS is generally found in children and adults infected with a dengue virus serotype differing from their respective primary infection. Thus, it is necessary to develop a vaccine that provides immunity to all four serotypes.
[0287]
The DENV E (envelope) protein is found on the viral surface and plays a role in the initial attachment of the viral particle to the host cell. Several molecules which interact with the viral E protein (ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin, CD209, Rab 5, GRP 78, and the mannose receptor) are thought to be important factors mediating attachment and viral entry.
[0288]
The DENV prM (membrane) protein is important in the formation and maturation of the viral particle. The membrane protein consists of seven antiparallel β-strands stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The glycoprotein shell of the mature DENV virion consists of 180 copies each of the E protein and M protein. The immature virion comprises E and prM proteins, which form 90 heterodimer spikes on the exterior of the viral particle. The immature viral particle buds into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually travels via the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus. As the virion passes through the trans-Golgi Network (TGN), it is exposed to an acidic environment which causes a conformational change in the E protein which causes it to disassociate from the prM protein and form E homodimers. During the maturation phase, the pr peptide is cleaved from the M peptide by the host protease, furin. The M protein then acts as a transmembrane protein under the E-protein shell of the mature virion. The pr peptide remains associated with the E protein until the viral particle is released into the extracellular environment, acting like a cap covering the hydrophobic fusion loop of the E protein until the viral particle has exited the cell.
[0289]
The DENV NS3 is a serine protease, as well as an RNA helicase and RTPase/NTPase. The protease domain consists of six β-strands arranged into two β-barrels formed by residues 1-180 of the protein. The catalytic triad (His-51, Asp-75 and Ser-135), is found between these two β-barrels, and its activity is dependent on the presence of the NS2B cofactor which wraps around the NS3 protease domain and becomes part of the active site. The remaining NS3 residues (180-618), form the three subdomains of the DENV helicase. A six-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices make up subdomains I and II, and subdomain III is composed of 4α-helices surrounded by three shorter α-helices and two antiparallel β-strands.
Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV)
[0290]
Presently, CHIKV is a re-emerging human pathogen that has now established itself in Southeast Asia and has more recently spread to Europe. The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was introduced into Asia around 1958, and sites of endemic transmission within Southeastern Asia, including the Indian Ocean, were observed through 1996. The CHIKV epidemic moved throughout Asia, reaching Europe and Africa in the early 2000s, and was imported via travelers to North America and South America from 2005 to 2007. Sporadic outbreaks are still occurring in several countries, such as Italy, infecting naive populations. Singapore, for instance, experienced two successive waves of Chikungunya virus outbreaks in January and August 2008. Of the two strain lineages of CHIKV, the African strain remains enzootic by cycling between mosquitoes and monkeys, but the Asian strain is transmitted directly between mosquitoes and humans. This cycle of transmission may have allowed the virus to become more pathogenic as the reservoir host was eliminated.
[0291]
In humans, CHIKV causes a debilitating disease characterized by fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, rash, muscle pain and joint pain. Following the acute phase of the illness, patients develop severe chronic symptoms lasting from several weeks to months, including fatigue, incapacitating joint pain and polyarthritis.
[0292]
The re-emergence of CHIKV has caused millions of cases throughout countries around the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia. Specifically, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand have reported over 1.9 million cases since 2005. Globally, human CHIKV epidemics from 2004-2011 have resulted in 1.4-6.5 million reported cases, including a number of deaths. Thus, CHIKV remains a public threat that constitutes a major public health problem with severe social and economic impact.
[0293]
Despite significant morbidity and some cases of mortality associated with CHIKV infection and its growing prevalence and geographic distribution, there is currently no licensed CHIKV vaccine or antiviral approved for human use. Several potential CHIKV vaccine candidates have been tested in humans and animals with varying success.
[0294]
Chikungunya virus is a small (about 60-70 nm diameter), spherical, enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus having a capsid with icosahedral symmetry. The virion consists of an envelope and a nucleocapsid. The virion RNA is infectious and serves as both genome and viral messenger RNA. The genome is a linear, ssRNA(+) genome of 11,805 nucleotides which encodes two polyproteins that are processed by host and viral proteases into non-structural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and RdRpnsP4) necessary for RNA synthesis (replication and transcription) and structural proteins (capsid and envelope proteins C, E3, E2, 6K, and E1) which attach to host receptors and mediate endocytosis of virus into the host cell. The E1 and E2 glycoproteins form heterodimers that associate as 80 trimeric spikes on the viral surface covering the surface evenly. The envelope glycoproteins play a role in attachment to cells. The capsid protein possesses a protease activity that results in its self-cleavage from the nascent structural protein. Following its cleavage, the capsid protein binds to viral RNA and rapidly assembles into icosahedric core particles. The resulting nucleocapsid eventually associates with the cytoplasmic domain of E2 at the cell membrane, leading to budding and formation of mature virions.
[0295]
E2 is an envelope glycoprotein responsible for viral attachment to target host cell, by binding to the cell receptor. E2 is synthesized as a p62 precursor which is processed at the cell membrane prior to virion budding, giving rise to an E2-E1 heterodimer. The C-terminus of E2 is involved in budding by interacting with capsid proteins.
[0296]
E1 is an envelope glycoprotein with fusion activity, which is inactive as long as E1 is bound to E2 in the mature virion. Following virus attachment to target cell and endocytosis, acidification of the endosome induces dissociation of the E1/E2 heterodimer and concomitant trimerization of the E1 subunits. The E1 trimer is fusion active and promotes the release of the viral nucleocapsid in the cytoplasm after endosome and viral membrane fusion.
[0297]
E3 is an accessory protein that functions as a membrane translocation/transport signal for E1 and E2.
[0298]
6K is another accessory protein involved in virus glycoprotein processing, cell permeabilization, and the budding of viral particles. Like E3, it functions as a membrane transport signal for E1 and E2.
[0299]
The CHIKV structural proteins have been shown to be antigenic, which proteins, fragments, and epitopes thereof are encompassed within the invention. A phylogenetic tree of Chikungunya virus strains derived from complete concatenated open reading frames for the nonstructural and structural polyproteins shows key envelope glycoprotein E1 amino acid substitutions that facilitated (Indian Ocean lineage) or prevented (Asian lineage) adaptation to Aedes albopictus. There are membrane-bound and secreted forms of E1 and E2, as well as the full length polyprotein antigen (C-E3-E2-6K-E1), which retains the protein's native conformation. Additionally, the different Chikungunya genotypes, strains and isolates can also yield different antigens, which are functional in the constructs of the invention. For example, there are several different Chikungunya genotypes: Indian Ocean, East/Central/South African (ECSA), Asian, West African, and the Brazilian isolates (ECSA/Asian). There are three main Chikungunya genotype. These are ESCA (East-South-Central Africa), Asia, and West Africa. While sometimes names differ in publications, all belong to these three geographical strains.

[0721]
It has been discovered that the mRNA vaccines described herein are superior to current vaccines in several ways. First, the lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery is superior to other formulations including a protamine base approach described in the literature and no additional adjuvants are to be necessary. The use of LNPs enables the effective delivery of chemically modified or unmodified mRNA vaccines. Additionally it has been demonstrated herein that both modified and unmodified LNP formulated mRNA vaccines were superior to conventional vaccines by a significant degree. In some embodiments the mRNA vaccines of the invention are superior to conventional vaccines by a factor of at least 10 fold, 20 fold, 40 fold, 50 fold, 100 fold, 500 fold or 1,000 fold.
[0722]
Although attempts have been made to produce functional RNA vaccines, including mRNA vaccines and self-replicating RNA vaccines, the therapeutic efficacy of these RNA vaccines has not yet been fully established. Quite surprisingly, the inventors have discovered, according to aspects of the invention a class of formulations for delivering mRNA vaccines in vivo that results in significantly enhanced, and in many respects synergistic, immune responses including enhanced antigen generation and functional antibody production with neutralization capability. These results can be achieved even when significantly lower doses of the mRNA are administered in comparison with mRNA doses used in other classes of lipid based formulations. The formulations of the invention have demonstrated significant unexpected in vivo immune responses sufficient to establish the efficacy of functional mRNA vaccines as prophylactic and therapeutic agents. Additionally, self-replicating RNA vaccines rely on viral replication pathways to deliver enough RNA to a cell to produce an immunogenic response. The formulations of the invention do not require viral replication to produce enough protein to result in a strong immune response. Thus, the mRNA of the invention are not self-replicating RNA and do not include components necessary for viral replication.
[0723]
The invention involves, in some aspects, the surprising finding that lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations significantly enhance the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, including chemically modified and unmodified mRNA vaccines. The efficacy of mRNA vaccines formulated in LNP was examined in vivo using several distinct antigens. The results presented herein demonstrate the unexpected superior efficacy of the mRNA vaccines formulated in LNP over other commercially available vaccines.
[0724]
In addition to providing an enhanced immune response, the formulations of the invention generate a more rapid immune response with fewer doses of antigen than other vaccines tested. The mRNA-LNP formulations of the invention also produce quantitatively and qualitatively better immune responses than vaccines formulated in a different carriers.
[0725]
The data described herein demonstrate that the formulations of the invention produced significant unexpected improvements over existing antigen vaccines. Additionally, the mRNA-LNP formulations of the invention are superior to other vaccines even when the dose of mRNA is lower than other vaccines.
[0726]
The LNP used in the studies described herein has been used previously to deliver siRNA in various animal models as well as in humans. In view of the observations made in association with the siRNA delivery of LNP formulations, the fact that LNP is useful in vaccines is quite surprising. It has been observed that therapeutic delivery of siRNA formulated in LNP causes an undesirable inflammatory response associated with a transient IgM response, typically leading to a reduction in antigen production and a compromised immune response. In contrast to the findings observed with siRNA, the LNP-mRNA formulations of the invention are demonstrated herein to generate enhanced IgG levels, sufficient for prophylactic and therapeutic methods rather than transient IgM responses.
Nucleic Acids/Polynucleotides
[0727]
Tropical disease vaccines, as provided herein, comprise at least one (one or more) ribonucleic acid (RNA) (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding at least one Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide. The term “nucleic acid” includes any compound and/or substance that comprises a polymer of nucleotides (nucleotide monomer). These polymers are referred to as polynucleotides. Thus, the terms “nucleic acid” and “polynucleotide” are used interchangeably.
[0728]
Nucleic acids may be or may include, for example, ribonucleic acids (RNAs), deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), threose nucleic acids (TNAs), glycol nucleic acids (GNAs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), locked nucleic acids (LNAs, including LNA having a β-D-ribo configuration, α-LNA having an α-L-ribo configuration (a diastereomer of LNA), 2′-amino-LNA having a 2′-amino functionalization, and 2′-amino-α-LNA having a 2′-amino functionalization), ethylene nucleic acids (ENA), cyclohexenyl nucleic acids (CeNA) or chimeras or combinations thereof.
[0729]
In some embodiments, polynucleotides of the present disclosure function as messenger RNA (mRNA). “Messenger RNA” (mRNA) refers to any polynucleotide that encodes a (at least one) polypeptide (a naturally-occurring, non-naturally-occurring, or modified polymer of amino acids) and can be translated to produce the encoded polypeptide in vitro, in vivo, in situ or ex vivo. The skilled artisan will appreciate that, except where otherwise noted, polynucleotide sequences set forth in the instant application will recite “T”s in a representative DNA sequence but where the sequence represents RNA (e.g., mRNA), the “T”s would be substituted for “U”s. Thus, any of the RNA polynucleotides encoded by a DNA identified by a particular sequence identification number may also comprise the corresponding RNA (e.g., mRNA) sequence encoded by the DNA, where each “T” of the DNA sequence is substituted with “U.”
[0730]
The basic components of an mRNA molecule typically include at least one coding region, a 5′ untranslated region (UTR), a 3′ UTR, a 5′ cap and a poly-A tail. Polynucleotides of the present disclosure may function as mRNA but can be distinguished from wild-type mRNA in their functional and/or structural design features, which serve to overcome existing problems of effective polypeptide expression using nucleic-acid based therapeutics.
[0731]
In some embodiments, a RNA polynucleotide of an RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine encodes 2-10, 2-9, 2-8, 2-7, 2-6, 2-5, 2-4, 2-3, 3-10, 3-9, 3-8, 3-7, 3-6, 3-5, 3-4, 4-10, 4-9, 4-8, 4-7, 4-6, 4-5, 5-10, 5-9, 5-8, 5-7, 5-6, 6-10, 6-9, 6-8, 6-7, 7-10, 7-9, 7-8, 8-10, 8-9 or 9-10 antigenic polypeptides. In some embodiments, a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide of a tropical disease vaccine encodes at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 antigenic polypeptides. In some embodiments, a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide of a tropical disease vaccine encodes at least 100 or at least 200 antigenic polypeptides. In some embodiments, a RNA polynucleotide of a tropical disease vaccine encodes 1-10, 5-15, 10-20, 15-25, 20-30, 25-35, 30-40, 35-45, 40-50, 1-50, 1-100, 2-50 or 2-100 antigenic polypeptides.
[0732]
Polynucleotides of the present disclosure, in some embodiments, are codon optimized. Codon optimization methods are known in the art and may be used as provided herein. Codon optimization, in some embodiments, may be used to match codon frequencies in target and host organisms to ensure proper folding; bias GC content to increase mRNA stability or reduce secondary structures; minimize tandem repeat codons or base runs that may impair gene construction or expression; customize transcriptional and translational control regions; insert or remove protein trafficking sequences; remove/add post translation modification sites in encoded protein (e.g. glycosylation sites); add, remove or shuffle protein domains; insert or delete restriction sites; modify ribosome binding sites and mRNA degradation sites; adjust translational rates to allow the various domains of the protein to fold properly; or to reduce or eliminate problem secondary structures within the polynucleotide. Codon optimization tools, algorithms and services are known in the art—non-limiting examples include services from GeneArt (Life Technologies), DNA2.0 (Menlo Park Calif.) and/or proprietary methods. In some embodiments, the open reading frame (ORF) sequence is optimized using optimization algorithms.
[0733]
In some embodiments, a codon optimized sequence shares less than 95% sequence identity, less than 90% sequence identity, less than 85% sequence identity, less than 80% sequence identity, or less than 75% sequence identity to a naturally-occurring or wild-type sequence (e.g., a naturally-occurring or wild-type mRNA sequence encoding a polypeptide or protein of interest (e.g., an antigenic protein or antigenic polypeptide)).
[0734]
In some embodiments, a codon-optimized sequence shares between 65% and 85% (e.g., between about 67% and about 85%, or between about 67% and about 80%) sequence identity to a naturally-occurring sequence or a wild-type sequence (e.g., a naturally-occurring or wild-type mRNA sequence encoding a polypeptide or protein of interest (e.g., an antigenic protein or polypeptide)). In some embodiments, a codon-optimized sequence shares between 65% and 75%, or about 80% sequence identity to a naturally-occurring sequence or wild-type sequence (e.g., a naturally-occurring or wild-type mRNA sequence encoding a polypeptide or protein of interest (e.g., an antigenic protein or polypeptide)).
[0735]
In some embodiments a codon-optimized RNA (e.g., mRNA) may, for instance, be one in which the levels of G/C are enhanced. The G/C-content of nucleic acid molecules may influence the stability of the RNA. RNA having an increased amount of guanine (G) and/or cytosine (C) residues may be functionally more stable than nucleic acids containing a large amount of adenine (A) and thymine (T) or uracil (U) nucleotides. WO02/098443 discloses a pharmaceutical composition containing an mRNA stabilized by sequence modifications in the translated region. Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, the modifications work by substituting existing codons for those that promote greater RNA stability without changing the resulting amino acid. The approach is limited to coding regions of the RNA.
Antigens/Antigenic Polypeptides
[0736]
In some embodiments, an antigenic polypeptide (e.g., at least one Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide) is longer than 25 amino acids and shorter than 50 amino acids. Polypeptides include gene products, naturally occurring polypeptides, synthetic polypeptides, homologs, orthologs, paralogs, fragments and other equivalents, variants, and analogs of the foregoing. A polypeptide may be a single molecule or may be a multi-molecular complex such as a dimer, trimer or tetramer. Polypeptides may also comprise single chain polypeptides or multichain polypeptides, such as antibodies or insulin, and may be associated or linked to each other. Most commonly, disulfide linkages are found in multichain polypeptides. The term “polypeptide” may also apply to amino acid polymers in which at least one amino acid residue is an artificial chemical analogue of a corresponding naturally-occurring amino acid.
[0737]
A “polypeptide variant” is a molecule that differs in its amino acid sequence relative to a native sequence or a reference sequence Amino acid sequence variants may possess substitutions, deletions, insertions, or a combination of any two or three of the foregoing, at certain positions within the amino acid sequence, as compared to a native sequence or a reference sequence. Ordinarily, variants possess at least 50% identity to a native sequence or a reference sequence. In some embodiments, variants share at least 80% identity or at least 90% identity with a native sequence or a reference sequence.
[0738]
In some embodiments “variant mimics” are provided. A “variant mimic” contains at least one amino acid that would mimic an activated sequence. For example, glutamate may serve as a mimic for phosphoro-threonine and/or phosphoro-serine. Alternatively, variant mimics may result in deactivation or in an inactivated product containing the mimic. For example, phenylalanine may act as an inactivating substitution for tyrosine, or alanine may act as an inactivating substitution for serine.
[0739]
“Orthologs” refers to genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation. Normally, orthologs retain the same function in the course of evolution. Identification of orthologs is important for reliable prediction of gene function in newly sequenced genomes.
[0740]
“Analogs” is meant to include polypeptide variants that differ by one or more amino acid alterations, for example, substitutions, additions or deletions of amino acid residues that still maintain one or more of the properties of the parent or starting polypeptide.
[0741]
The present disclosure provides several types of compositions that are polynucleotide or polypeptide based, including variants and derivatives. These include, for example, substitutional, insertional, deletion and covalent variants and derivatives. The term “derivative” is synonymous with the term “variant” and generally refers to a molecule that has been modified and/or changed in any way relative to a reference molecule or a starting molecule.
[0742]
As such, polynucleotides encoding peptides or polypeptides containing substitutions, insertions and/or additions, deletions and covalent modifications with respect to reference sequences, in particular the polypeptide sequences disclosed herein, are included within the scope of this disclosure. For example, sequence tags or amino acids, such as one or more lysines, can be added to peptide sequences (e.g., at the N-terminal or C-terminal ends). Sequence tags can be used for peptide detection, purification or localization. Lysines can be used to increase peptide solubility or to allow for biotinylation. Alternatively, amino acid residues located at the carboxy and amino terminal regions of the amino acid sequence of a peptide or protein may optionally be deleted providing for truncated sequences. Certain amino acids (e.g., C-terminal residues or N-terminal residues) alternatively may be deleted depending on the use of the sequence, as for example, expression of the sequence as part of a larger sequence that is soluble, or linked to a solid support.
[0743]
“Substitutional variants” when referring to polypeptides are those that have at least one amino acid residue in a native or starting sequence removed and a different amino acid inserted in its place at the same position. Substitutions may be single, where only one amino acid in the molecule has been substituted, or they may be multiple, where two or more (e.g., 3, 4 or 5) amino acids have been substituted in the same molecule.
[0744]
As used herein the term “conservative amino acid substitution” refers to the substitution of an amino acid that is normally present in the sequence with a different amino acid of similar size, charge, or polarity. Examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of a non-polar (hydrophobic) residue such as isoleucine, valine and leucine for another non-polar residue. Likewise, examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of one polar (hydrophilic) residue for another such as between arginine and lysine, between glutamine and asparagine, and between glycine and serine. Additionally, the substitution of a basic residue such as lysine, arginine or histidine for another, or the substitution of one acidic residue such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid for another acidic residue are additional examples of conservative substitutions. Examples of non-conservative substitutions include the substitution of a non-polar (hydrophobic) amino acid residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine, alanine, methionine for a polar (hydrophilic) residue such as cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid or lysine and/or a polar residue for a non-polar residue.
[0745]
“Features” when referring to polypeptide or polynucleotide are defined as distinct amino acid sequence-based or nucleotide-based components of a molecule respectively. Features of the polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides include surface manifestations, local conformational shape, folds, loops, half-loops, domains, half-domains, sites, termini and any combination(s) thereof.
[0746]
As used herein when referring to polypeptides the term “domain” refers to a motif of a polypeptide having one or more identifiable structural or functional characteristics or properties (e.g., binding capacity, serving as a site for protein-protein interactions).
[0747]
As used herein when referring to polypeptides the terms “site” as it pertains to amino acid based embodiments is used synonymously with “amino acid residue” and “amino acid side chain.” As used herein when referring to polynucleotides the terms “site” as it pertains to nucleotide based embodiments is used synonymously with “nucleotide.” A site represents a position within a peptide or polypeptide or polynucleotide that may be modified, manipulated, altered, derivatized or varied within the polypeptide-based or polynucleotide-based molecules.
[0748]
As used herein the terms “termini” or “terminus” when referring to polypeptides or polynucleotides refer to an extremity of a polypeptide or polynucleotide respectively. Such extremity is not limited only to the first or final site of the polypeptide or polynucleotide but may include additional amino acids or nucleotides in the terminal regions. Polypeptide-based molecules may be characterized as having both an N-terminus (terminated by an amino acid with a free amino group (NH2)) and a C-terminus (terminated by an amino acid with a free carboxyl group (COOH)). Proteins are in some cases made up of multiple polypeptide chains brought together by disulfide bonds or by non-covalent forces (multimers, oligomers). These proteins have multiple N- and C-termini. Alternatively, the termini of the polypeptides may be modified such that they begin or end, as the case may be, with a non-polypeptide based moiety such as an organic conjugate.
[0749]
As recognized by those skilled in the art, protein fragments, functional protein domains, and homologous proteins are also considered to be within the scope of polypeptides of interest. For example, provided herein is any protein fragment (meaning a polypeptide sequence at least one amino acid residue shorter than a reference polypeptide sequence but otherwise identical) of a reference protein having a length of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 or longer than 100 amino acids. In another example, any protein that includes a stretch of 20, 30, 40, 50, or 100 (contiguous) amino acids that are 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 100% identical to any of the sequences described herein can be utilized in accordance with the disclosure. In some embodiments, a polypeptide includes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more mutations as shown in any of the sequences provided herein or referenced herein. In another example, any protein that includes a stretch of 20, 30, 40, 50, or 100 amino acids that are greater than 80%, 90%, 95%, or 100% identical to any of the sequences described herein, wherein the protein has a stretch of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 amino acids that are less than 80%, 75%, 70%, 65% to 60% identical to any of the sequences described herein can be utilized in accordance with the disclosure.
[0750]
Polypeptide or polynucleotide molecules of the present disclosure may share a certain degree of sequence similarity or identity with the reference molecules (e.g., reference polypeptides or reference polynucleotides), for example, with art-described molecules (e.g., engineered or designed molecules or wild-type molecules). The term “identity,” as known in the art, refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more polypeptides or polynucleotides, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, identity also means the degree of sequence relatedness between two sequences as determined by the number of matches between strings of two or more amino acid residues or nucleic acid residues. Identity measures the percent of identical matches between the smaller of two or more sequences with gap alignments (if any) addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (e.g., “algorithms”). Identity of related peptides can be readily calculated by known methods. “% identity” as it applies to polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences is defined as the percentage of residues (amino acid residues or nucleic acid residues) in the candidate amino acid or nucleic acid sequence that are identical with the residues in the amino acid sequence or nucleic acid sequence of a second sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent identity. Methods and computer programs for the alignment are well known in the art. Identity depends on a calculation of percent identity but may differ in value due to gaps and penalties introduced in the calculation. Generally, variants of a particular polynucleotide or polypeptide have at least 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% but less than 100% sequence identity to that particular reference polynucleotide or polypeptide as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described herein and known to those skilled in the art. Such tools for alignment include those of the BLAST suite (Stephen F. Altschul, et al. (1997). “Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs,” Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402). Another popular local alignment technique is based on the Smith-Waterman algorithm (Smith, T. F. & Waterman, M. S. (1981) “Identification of common molecular subsequences.” J. Mol. Biol. 147:195-197). A general global alignment technique based on dynamic programming is the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman, S. B. & Wunsch, C. D. (1970) “A general method applicable to the search for similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins.” J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453). More recently, a Fast Optimal Global Sequence Alignment Algorithm (FOGSAA) was developed that purportedly produces global alignment of nucleotide and protein sequences faster than other optimal global alignment methods, including the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Other tools are described herein, specifically in the definition of “identity” below.
[0751]
As used herein, the term “homology” refers to the overall relatedness between polymeric molecules, e.g. between nucleic acid molecules (e.g. DNA molecules and/or RNA molecules) and/or between polypeptide molecules. Polymeric molecules (e.g. nucleic acid molecules (e.g. DNA molecules and/or RNA molecules) and/or polypeptide molecules) that share a threshold level of similarity or identity determined by alignment of matching residues are termed homologous. Homology is a qualitative term that describes a relationship between molecules and can be based upon the quantitative similarity or identity. Similarity or identity is a quantitative term that defines the degree of sequence match between two compared sequences. In some embodiments, polymeric molecules are considered to be “homologous” to one another if their sequences are at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% identical or similar. The term “homologous” necessarily refers to a comparison between at least two sequences (polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences). Two polynucleotide sequences are considered homologous if the polypeptides they encode are at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or even 99% for at least one stretch of at least 20 amino acids. In some embodiments, homologous polynucleotide sequences are characterized by the ability to encode a stretch of at least 4-5 uniquely specified amino acids. For polynucleotide sequences less than 60 nucleotides in length, homology is determined by the ability to encode a stretch of at least 4-5 uniquely specified amino acids. Two protein sequences are considered homologous if the proteins are at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% identical for at least one stretch of at least 20 amino acids.
[0752]
Homology implies that the compared sequences diverged in evolution from a common origin. The term “homolog” refers to a first amino acid sequence or nucleic acid sequence (e.g., gene (DNA or RNA) or protein sequence) that is related to a second amino acid sequence or nucleic acid sequence by descent from a common ancestral sequence. The term “homolog” may apply to the relationship between genes and/or proteins separated by the event of speciation or to the relationship between genes and/or proteins separated by the event of genetic duplication. “Orthologs” are genes (or proteins) in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene (or protein) by speciation. Typically, orthologs retain the same function in the course of evolution. “Paralogs” are genes (or proteins) related by duplication within a genome. Orthologs retain the same function in the course of evolution, whereas paralogs evolve new functions, even if these are related to the original one.
[0753]
The term “identity” refers to the overall relatedness between polymeric molecules, for example, between polynucleotide molecules (e.g. DNA molecules and/or RNA molecules) and/or between polypeptide molecules. Calculation of the percent identity of two polynucleic acid sequences, for example, can be performed by aligning the two sequences for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second nucleic acid sequences for optimal alignment and non-identical sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In certain embodiments, the length of a sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The nucleotides at corresponding nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which needs to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example, the percent identity between two nucleic acid sequences can be determined using methods such as those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, 1991; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the percent identity between two nucleic acid sequences can be determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller (CABIOS, 1989, 4:11-17), which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The percent identity between two nucleic acid sequences can, alternatively, be determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package using an NWSgapdna.CMP matrix. Methods commonly employed to determine percent identity between sequences include, but are not limited to those disclosed in Carillo, H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J Applied Math., 48:1073 (1988); incorporated herein by reference. Techniques for determining identity are codified in publicly available computer programs. Exemplary computer software to determine homology between two sequences include, but are not limited to, GCG program package, Devereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 12, 387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA Altschul, S. F. et al., J. Molec. Biol., 215, 403 (1990)).
Multiprotein and Multicomponent Vaccines
[0754]
The present disclosure encompasses tropical disease vaccines comprising multiple RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides, each encoding a single antigenic polypeptide, as well as tropical disease vaccines comprising a single RNA polynucleotide encoding more than one antigenic polypeptide (e.g., as a fusion polypeptide). Thus, a vaccine composition comprising a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a first antigenic polypeptide and a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a second antigenic polypeptide encompasses (a) vaccines that comprise a first RNA polynucleotide encoding a first antigenic polypeptide and a second RNA polynucleotide encoding a second antigenic polypeptide, and (b) vaccines that comprise a single RNA polynucleotide encoding a first and second antigenic polypeptide (e.g., as a fusion polypeptide). RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines of the present disclosure, in some embodiments, comprise 2-10 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10), or more, RNA polynucleotides having an open reading frame, each of which encodes a different antigenic polypeptide (or a single RNA polynucleotide encoding 2-10, or more, different antigenic polypeptides). The antigenic polypeptides may be selected from Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and YFV antigenic polypeptides.
[0755]
In some embodiments, a tropical disease vaccine comprises a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a viral capsid protein, a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a viral premembrane/membrane protein, and a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a viral envelope protein. In some embodiments, a tropical disease vaccine comprises a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a viral fusion (F) protein and a RNA polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a viral major surface glycoprotein (G protein). In some embodiments, a vaccine comprises a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a viral F protein. In some embodiments, a vaccine comprises a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a viral G protein. In some embodiments, a vaccine comprises a RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding a HN protein.
[0756]
In some embodiments, a multicomponent vaccine comprises at least one RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotide encoding at least one antigenic polypeptide fused to a signal peptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 304-307). The signal peptide may be fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of an antigenic polypeptide. An antigenic polypeptide fused to a signal peptide may be selected from Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and YFV antigenic polypeptides.
Signal Peptides
[0757]
In some embodiments, antigenic polypeptides encoded by tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides comprise a signal peptide. Signal peptides, comprising the N-terminal 15-60 amino acids of proteins, are typically needed for the translocation across the membrane on the secretory pathway and, thus, universally control the entry of most proteins both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes to the secretory pathway. Signal peptides generally include three regions: an N-terminal region of differing length, which usually comprises positively charged amino acids; a hydrophobic region; and a short carboxy-terminal peptide region. In eukaryotes, the signal peptide of a nascent precursor protein (pre-protein) directs the ribosome to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and initiates the transport of the growing peptide chain across it for processing. ER processing produces mature proteins, wherein the signal peptide is cleaved from precursor proteins, typically by a ER-resident signal peptidase of the host cell, or they remain uncleaved and function as a membrane anchor. A signal peptide may also facilitate the targeting of the protein to the cell membrane. The signal peptide, however, is not responsible for the final destination of the mature protein. Secretory proteins devoid of additional address tags in their sequence are by default secreted to the external environment. During recent years, a more advanced view of signal peptides has evolved, showing that the functions and immunodominance of certain signal peptides are much more versatile than previously anticipated.
[0758]
Tropical disease vaccines of the present disclosure may comprise, for example, RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides encoding an artificial signal peptide, wherein the signal peptide coding sequence is operably linked to and is in frame with the coding sequence of the antigenic polypeptide. Thus, tropical disease vaccines of the present disclosure, in some embodiments, produce an antigenic polypeptide (e.g., a Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide) fused to a signal peptide. In some embodiments, a signal peptide is fused to the N-terminus of the antigenic polypeptide. In some embodiments, a signal peptide is fused to the C-terminus of the antigenic polypeptide.
[0759]
In some embodiments, the signal peptide fused to the antigenic polypeptide is an artificial signal peptide. In some embodiments, an artificial signal peptide fused to the antigenic polypeptide encoded by the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine is obtained from an immunoglobulin protein, e.g., an IgE signal peptide or an IgG signal peptide. In some embodiments, a signal peptide fused to the antigenic polypeptide encoded by a RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine is an Ig heavy chain epsilon-1 signal peptide (IgE HC SP) having the sequence of: MDWTWILFLVAAATRVHS; SEQ ID NO: 424. In some embodiments, a signal peptide fused to the antigenic polypeptide encoded by the (e.g., mRNA) RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine is an IgGk chain V-III region HAH signal peptide (IgGk SP) having the sequence of METPAQLLFLLLLWLPDTTG; SEQ ID NO: 423. In some embodiments, the signal peptide is selected from: Japanese encephalitis PRM signal sequence (MLGSNSGQRVVFTILLLLVAPAYS; SEQ ID NO: 425), VSINVg protein signal sequence (MKCLLYLAFLFIGVNCA; SEQ ID NO: 426) and Japanese encephalitis JEV signal sequence (MWLVSLAIVTACAGA; SEQ ID NO: 427).
[0760]
In some embodiments, the antigenic polypeptide encoded by a RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine comprises an amino acid sequence identified by any one of SEQ ID NO: 13-17, 22-29, 44-47, 52-54, 59-64, 97-117, 156-222, 469, 259-291 or 402-413 fused to a signal peptide identified by any one of SEQ ID NO: 423-427. The examples disclosed herein are not meant to be limiting and any signal peptide that is known in the art to facilitate targeting of a protein to ER for processing and/or targeting of a protein to the cell membrane may be used in accordance with the present disclosure.
[0761]
A signal peptide may have a length of 15-60 amino acids. For example, a signal peptide may have a length of 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, or 60 amino acids. In some embodiments, a signal peptide has a length of 20-60, 25-60, 30-60, 35-60, 40-60, 45-60, 50-60, 55-60, 15-55, 20-55, 25-55, 30-55, 35-55, 40-55, 45-55, 50-55, 15-50, 20-50, 25-50, 30-50, 35-50, 40-50, 45-50, 15-45, 20-45, 25-45, 30-45, 35-45, 40-45, 15-40, 20-40, 25-40, 30-40, 35-40, 15-35, 20-35, 25-35, 30-35, 15-30, 20-30, 25-30, 15-25, 20-25, or 15-20 amino acids.
[0762]
A signal peptide is typically cleaved from the nascent polypeptide at the cleavage junction during ER processing. The mature antigenic polypeptide produce by a tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine of the present disclosure typically does not comprise a signal peptide.
Chemical Modifications
[0763]
Tropical disease vaccines of the present disclosure, in some embodiments, comprise at least RNA (e.g. mRNA) polynucleotide having an open reading frame encoding at least one antigenic polypeptide that comprises at least one chemical modification.
[0764]
The terms “chemical modification” and “chemically modified” refer to modification with respect to adenosine (A), guanosine (G), uridine (U), thymidine (T) or cytidine (C) ribonucleosides or deoxyribnucleosides in at least one of their position, pattern, percent or population. Generally, these terms do not refer to the ribonucleotide modifications in naturally occurring 5′-terminal mRNA cap moieties. With respect to a polypeptide, the term “modification” refers to a modification relative to the canonical set 20 amino acids. Polypeptides, as provided herein, are also considered “modified” of they contain amino acid substitutions, insertions or a combination of substitutions and insertions.
[0765]
Polynucleotides (e.g., RNA polynucleotides, such as mRNA polynucleotides), in some embodiments, comprise various (more than one) different modifications. In some embodiments, a particular region of a polynucleotide contains one, two or more (optionally different) nucleoside or nucleotide modifications. In some embodiments, a modified RNA polynucleotide (e.g., a modified mRNA polynucleotide), introduced to a cell or organism, exhibits reduced degradation in the cell or organism, respectively, relative to an unmodified polynucleotide. In some embodiments, a modified RNA polynucleotide (e.g., a modified mRNA polynucleotide), introduced into a cell or organism, may exhibit reduced immunogenicity in the cell or organism, respectively (e.g., a reduced innate response).
[0766]
Modifications of polynucleotides include, without limitation, those described herein. Polynucleotides (e.g., RNA polynucleotides, such as mRNA polynucleotides) may comprise modifications that are naturally-occurring, non-naturally-occurring or the polynucleotide may comprise a combination of naturally-occurring and non-naturally-occurring modifications. Polynucleotides may include any useful modification, for example, of a sugar, a nucleobase, or an internucleoside linkage (e.g., to a linking phosphate, to a phosphodiester linkage or to the phosphodiester backbone).
[0767]
Polynucleotides (e.g., RNA polynucleotides, such as mRNA polynucleotides), in some embodiments, comprise non-natural modified nucleotides that are introduced during synthesis or post-synthesis of the polynucleotides to achieve desired functions or properties. The modifications may be present on an internucleotide linkages, purine or pyrimidine bases, or sugars. The modification may be introduced with chemical synthesis or with a polymerase enzyme at the terminal of a chain or anywhere else in the chain. Any of the regions of a polynucleotide may be chemically modified.
[0768]
The present disclosure provides for modified nucleosides and nucleotides of a polynucleotide (e.g., RNA polynucleotides, such as mRNA polynucleotides). A “nucleoside” refers to a compound containing a sugar molecule (e.g., a pentose or ribose) or a derivative thereof in combination with an organic base (e.g., a purine or pyrimidine) or a derivative thereof (also referred to herein as “nucleobase”). A “nucleotide” refers to a nucleoside, including a phosphate group. Modified nucleotides may by synthesized by any useful method, such as, for example, chemically, enzymatically, or recombinantly, to include one or more modified or non-natural nucleosides. Polynucleotides may comprise a region or regions of linked nucleosides. Such regions may have variable backbone linkages. The linkages may be standard phosphodiester linkages, in which case the polynucleotides would comprise regions of nucleotides.
[0769]
Modified nucleotide base pairing encompasses not only the standard adenosine-thymine, adenosine-uracil, or guanosine-cytosine base pairs, but also base pairs formed between nucleotides and/or modified nucleotides comprising non-standard or modified bases, wherein the arrangement of hydrogen bond donors and hydrogen bond acceptors permits hydrogen bonding between a non-standard base and a standard base or between two complementary non-standard base structures. One example of such non-standard base pairing is the base pairing between the modified nucleotide inosine and adenine, cytosine or uracil. Any combination of base/sugar or linker may be incorporated into polynucleotides of the present disclosure.
[0770]

N-Linked Glycosylation Site Mutants
[0788]
N-linked glycans of viral proteins play important roles in modulating the immune response. Glycans can be important for maintaining the appropriate antigenic conformations, shielding potential neutralization epitopes, and may alter the proteolytic susceptibility of proteins. Some viruses have putative N-linked glycosylation sites. Deletion or modification of an N-linked glycosylation site may enhance the immune response. Thus, the present disclosure provides, in some embodiments, RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines comprising nucleic acids (e.g., mRNA) encoding antigenic polypeptides that comprise a deletion or modification at one or more N-linked glycosylation sites.
In Vitro Transcription of RNA (e.g., mRNA)
[0789]
Tropical disease vaccines of the present disclosure comprise at least one RNA polynucleotide, such as a mRNA (e.g., modified mRNA). mRNA, for example, is transcribed in vitro from template DNA, referred to as an “in vitro transcription template.” In some embodiments, an in vitro transcription template encodes a 5′ untranslated (UTR) region, contains an open reading frame, and encodes a 3′ UTR and a polyA tail. The particular nucleic acid sequence composition and length of an in vitro transcription template will depend on the mRNA encoded by the template.
[0790]
A “5′ untranslated region” (5′UTR) refers to a region of an mRNA that is directly upstream (i.e., 5′) from the start codon (i.e., the first codon of an mRNA transcript translated by a ribosome) that does not encode a polypeptide.
[0791]
A “3′ untranslated region” (3′UTR) refers to a region of an mRNA that is directly downstream (i.e., 3′) from the stop codon (i.e., the codon of an mRNA transcript that signals a termination of translation) that does not encode a polypeptide.
[0792]
An “open reading frame” is a continuous stretch of DNA beginning with a start codon (e.g., methionine (ATG)), and ending with a stop codon (e.g., TAA, TAG or TGA) and encodes a polypeptide.
[0793]
A “polyA tail” is a region of mRNA that is downstream, e.g., directly downstream (i.e., 3′), from the 3′ UTR that contains multiple, consecutive adenosine monophosphates. A polyA tail may contain 10 to 300 adenosine monophosphates. For example, a polyA tail may contain 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290 or 300 adenosine monophosphates. In some embodiments, a polyA tail contains 50 to 250 adenosine monophosphates. In a relevant biological setting (e.g., in cells, in vivo) the poly(A) tail functions to protect mRNA from enzymatic degradation, e.g., in the cytoplasm, and aids in transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus and translation.
[0794]
In some embodiments, a polynucleotide includes 200 to 3,000 nucleotides. For example, a polynucleotide may include 200 to 500, 200 to 1000, 200 to 1500, 200 to 3000, 500 to 1000, 500 to 1500, 500 to 2000, 500 to 3000, 1000 to 1500, 1000 to 2000, 1000 to 3000, 1500 to 3000, or 2000 to 3000 nucleotides.
Flagellin Adjuvants
[0795]
Flagellin is an approximately 500 amino acid monomeric protein that polymerizes to form the flagella associated with bacterial motion. Flagellin is expressed by a variety of flagellated bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium for example) as well as non-flagellated bacteria (such as Escherichia coli). Sensing of flagellin by cells of the innate immune system (dendritic cells, macrophages, etc.) is mediated by the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) as well as by Nod-like receptors (NLRs) Ipaf and Naip5. TLRs and NLRs have been identified as playing a role in the activation of innate immune response and adaptive immune response. As such, flagellin provides an adjuvant effect in a vaccine.
[0796]
The nucleotide and amino acid sequences encoding known flagellin polypeptides are publicly available in the NCBI GenBank database. The flagellin sequences from S. Typhimurium, H. Pylori, V. Cholera, S. marcesens, S. flexneri, T. pallidum, L. pneumophila, B. burgdorferei, C. difficile, R. meliloti, A. tumefaciens, R. lupini, B. clarridgeiae, P. Mirabilis, B. subtilus, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli, among others are known.
[0797]
A flagellin polypeptide, as used herein, refers to a full length flagellin protein, immunogenic fragments thereof, and peptides having at least 50% sequence identity to a flagellin protein or immunogenic fragments thereof. Exemplary flagellin proteins include flagellin from Salmonella typhi (UniPro Entry number: Q56086), Salmonella typhimurium (A0A0C9DG09), Salmonella enteritidis (A0A0C9BAB7), and Salmonella choleraesuis (Q6V2X8), and proteins having an amino acid sequence identified by any one of SEQ ID NO: 420-422 (Table 66). In some embodiments, the flagellin polypeptide has at least 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to a flagellin protein or immunogenic fragments thereof.
[0798]
In some embodiments, the flagellin polypeptide is an immunogenic fragment. An immunogenic fragment is a portion of a flagellin protein that provokes an immune response. In some embodiments, the immune response is a TLR5 immune response. An example of an immunogenic fragment is a flagellin protein in which all or a portion of a hinge region has been deleted or replaced with other amino acids. For example, an antigenic polypeptide may be inserted in the hinge region. Hinge regions are the hypervariable regions of a flagellin. Hinge regions of a flagellin are also referred to as “D3 domain or region,” “propeller domain or region,” “hypervariable domain or region” and “variable domain or region.” “At least a portion of a hinge region,” as used herein, refers to any part of the hinge region of the flagellin, or the entirety of the hinge region. In other embodiments an immunogenic fragment of flagellin is a 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 amino acid C-terminal fragment of flagellin.
[0799]
The flagellin monomer is formed by domains D0 through D3. D0 and D1, which form the stem, are composed of tandem long alpha helices and are highly conserved among different bacteria. The D1 domain includes several stretches of amino acids that are useful for TLR5 activation. The entire D1 domain or one or more of the active regions within the domain are immunogenic fragments of flagellin. Examples of immunogenic regions within the D1 domain include residues 88-114 and residues 411-431 in Salmonella typhimurium FliC flagellin. Within the 13 amino acids in the 88-100 region, at least 6 substitutions are permitted between Salmonella flagellin and other flagellins that still preserve TLR5 activation. Thus, immunogenic fragments of flagellin include flagellin like sequences that activate TLR5 and contain a 13 amino acid motif that is 53% or more identical to the Salmonella sequence in 88-100 of FliC (LQRVRELAVQSAN; SEQ ID NO: 428).
[0800]
In some embodiments, the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine includes an RNA that encodes a fusion protein of flagellin and one or more antigenic polypeptides. A “fusion protein” as used herein, refers to a linking of two components of the construct. In some embodiments, a carboxy-terminus of the antigenic polypeptide is fused or linked to an amino terminus of the flagellin polypeptide. In other embodiments, an amino-terminus of the antigenic polypeptide is fused or linked to a carboxy-terminus of the flagellin polypeptide. The fusion protein may include, for example, one, two, three, four, five, six or more flagellin polypeptides linked to one, two, three, four, five, six or more antigenic polypeptides. When two or more flagellin polypeptides and/or two or more antigenic polypeptides are linked such a construct may be referred to as a “multimer.”
[0801]
Each of the components of a fusion protein may be directly linked to one another or they may be connected through a linker. For instance, the linker may be an amino acid linker. The amino acid linker encoded for by the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine to link the components of the fusion protein may include, for instance, at least one member selected from the group consisting of a lysine residue, a glutamic acid residue, a serine residue and an arginine residue. In some embodiments the linker is 1-30, 1-25, 1-25, 5-10, 5, 15, or 5-20 amino acids in length.
[0802]
In other embodiments the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine includes at least two separate RNA polynucleotides, one encoding one or more antigenic polypeptides and the other encoding the flagellin polypeptide. The at least two RNA polynucleotides may be coformulated in a carrier such as a lipid nanoparticle.
Broad Spectrum RNA (e.g., mRNA) Vaccines
[0803]
There may be situations where persons are at risk for infection with more than one strain of Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV. RNA (e.g., mRNA) therapeutic vaccines are particularly amenable to combination vaccination approaches due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, speed of manufacture, ability to rapidly tailor vaccines to accommodate perceived geographical threat, and the like. Moreover, because the vaccines utilize the human body to produce the antigenic protein, the vaccines are amenable to the production of larger, more complex antigenic proteins, allowing for proper folding, surface expression, antigen presentation, etc. in the human subject. To protect against more than one strain of Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV, a combination vaccine can be administered that includes RNA (e.g., mRNA) encoding at least one antigenic polypeptide protein (or antigenic portion thereof) of a first tropical disease virus or organism and further includes RNA encoding at least one antigenic polypeptide protein (or antigenic portion thereof) of a second tropical disease virus or organism. RNA (e.g., mRNA) can be coformulated, for example, in a single lipid nanoparticle (LNP) or can be formulated in separate LNPs for co-administration.
Methods of Treatment

Provided herein are compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions), methods, kits and reagents for prevention and/or treatment of tropical diseases in humans and other mammals Tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines can be used as therapeutic or prophylactic agents, alone or in combination with other vaccine(s). They may be used in medicine to prevent and/or treat tropical disease. In exemplary aspects, the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines of the present disclosure are used to provide prophylactic protection from Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV. Prophylactic protection from Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV can be achieved following administration of a RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine of the present disclosure. Tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines of the present disclosure may be used to treat or prevent viral “co-infections” containing two or more tropical disease infections. Vaccines can be administered once, twice, three times, four times or more, but it is likely sufficient to administer the vaccine once (optionally followed by a single booster). It is possible, although less desirable, to administer the vaccine to an infected individual to achieve a therapeutic response. Dosing may need to be adjusted accordingly.

[0807]
A prophylactically effective dose is a therapeutically effective dose that prevents infection with the virus at a clinically acceptable level. In some embodiments the therapeutically effective dose is a dose listed in a package insert for the vaccine. A traditional vaccine, as used herein, refers to a vaccine other than the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines of the present disclosure. For instance, a traditional vaccine includes but is not limited to live/attenuated microorganism vaccines, killed/inactivated microorganism vaccines, subunit vaccines, protein antigen vaccines, DNA vaccines, VLP vaccines, etc. In exemplary embodiments, a traditional vaccine is a vaccine that has achieved regulatory approval and/or is registered by a national drug regulatory body, for example the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States or the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
[0808]
In some embodiments the anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer in the subject is increased 1 log to 10 log following vaccination relative to anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer in a subject vaccinated with a prophylactically effective dose of a traditional vaccine against Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV.

Therapeutic and Prophylactic Compositions
[0818]
Provided herein are compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions), methods, kits and reagents for prevention, treatment or diagnosis of Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV in humans and other mammals, for example. Tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines can be used as therapeutic or prophylactic agents. They may be used in medicine to prevent and/or treat infectious disease. In some embodiments, the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines of the present disclosure are used fin the priming of immune effector cells, for example, to activate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ex vivo, which are then infused (re-infused) into a subject.
[0819]
In some embodiments, tropical disease vaccine containing RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides as described herein can be administered to a subject (e.g., a mammalian subject, such as a human subject), and the RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides are translated in vivo to produce an antigenic polypeptide.
[0820]
The tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines may be induced for translation of a polypeptide (e.g., antigen or immunogen) in a cell, tissue or organism. In some embodiments, such translation occurs in vivo, although such translation may occur ex vivo, in culture or in vitro. In some embodiments, the cell, tissue or organism is contacted with an effective amount of a composition containing a tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine that contains a polynucleotide that has at least one a translatable region encoding an antigenic polypeptide.
[0821]
An “effective amount” of a tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccine is provided based, at least in part, on the target tissue, target cell type, means of administration, physical characteristics of the polynucleotide (e.g., size, and extent of modified nucleosides) and other components of the vaccine, and other determinants. In general, an effective amount of the tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine composition provides an induced or boosted immune response as a function of antigen production in the cell, preferably more efficient than a composition containing a corresponding unmodified polynucleotide encoding the same antigen or a peptide antigen. Increased antigen production may be demonstrated by increased cell transfection (the percentage of cells transfected with the RNA, e.g., mRNA, vaccine), increased protein translation from the polynucleotide, decreased nucleic acid degradation (as demonstrated, for example, by increased duration of protein translation from a modified polynucleotide), or altered antigen specific immune response of the host cell.
[0822]
In some embodiments, RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines (including polynucleotides their encoded polypeptides) in accordance with the present disclosure may be used for treatment of Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV.
[0823]
Tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines may be administered prophylactically or therapeutically as part of an active immunization scheme to healthy individuals or early in infection during the incubation phase or during active infection after onset of symptoms. In some embodiments, the amount of RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine of the present disclosure provided to a cell, a tissue or a subject may be an amount effective for immune prophylaxis.
[0824]
Tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines may be administrated with other prophylactic or therapeutic compounds. As a non-limiting example, a prophylactic or therapeutic compound may be an adjuvant or a booster. As used herein, when referring to a prophylactic composition, such as a vaccine, the term “booster” refers to an extra administration of the prophylactic (vaccine) composition. A booster (or booster vaccine) may be given after an earlier administration of the prophylactic composition. The time of administration between the initial administration of the prophylactic composition and the booster may be, but is not limited to, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, 6 minutes, 7 minutes, 8 minutes, 9 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes 35 minutes, 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours, 22 hours, 23 hours, 1 day, 36 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 1 week, 10 days, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 1 year, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years, 11 years, 12 years, 13 years, 14 years, 15 years, 16 years, 17 years, 18 years, 19 years, 20 years, 25 years, 30 years, 35 years, 40 years, 45 years, 50 years, 55 years, 60 years, 65 years, 70 years, 75 years, 80 years, 85 years, 90 years, 95 years or more than 99 years. In some embodiments, the time of administration between the initial administration of the prophylactic composition and the booster may be, but is not limited to, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months or 1 year.
[0825]
In some embodiments, tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines may be administered intramuscularly, intradermally, or intranasally, similarly to the administration of inactivated vaccines known in the art.
[0826]
Tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines may be utilized in various settings depending on the prevalence of the infection or the degree or level of unmet medical need. As a non-limiting example, the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines may be utilized to treat and/or prevent a variety of tropical diseases. RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines have superior properties in that they produce much larger antibody titers and produce responses early than commercially available anti-viral agents/compositions.
[0827]
Provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions including tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines and RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccine compositions and/or complexes optionally in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.
[0828]
Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines may be formulated or administered alone or in conjunction with one or more other components. For instance, Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines (vaccine compositions) may comprise other components including, but not limited to, adjuvants.
[0829]
In some embodiments, tropical disease (e.g. mRNA) vaccines do not include an adjuvant (they are adjuvant free).
[0830]
Tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines may be formulated or administered in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients. In some embodiments, vaccine compositions comprise at least one additional active substances, such as, for example, a therapeutically-active substance, a prophylactically-active substance, or a combination of both. Vaccine compositions may be sterile, pyrogen-free or both sterile and pyrogen-free. General considerations in the formulation and/or manufacture of pharmaceutical agents, such as vaccine compositions, may be found, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).
[0831]
In some embodiments, tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines are administered to humans, human patients or subjects. For the purposes of the present disclosure, the phrase “active ingredient” generally refers to the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines or the polynucleotides contained therein, for example, RNA polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA polynucleotides) encoding antigenic polypeptides.
[0832]
Formulations of the tropical disease vaccine compositions described herein may be prepared by any method known or hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology. In general, such preparatory methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient (e.g., mRNA polynucleotide) into association with an excipient and/or one or more other accessory ingredients, and then, if necessary and/or desirable, dividing, shaping and/or packaging the product into a desired single- or multi-dose unit.
[0833]
Relative amounts of the active ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, and/or any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the disclosure will vary, depending upon the identity, size, and/or condition of the subject treated and further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered. By way of example, the composition may comprise between 0.1% and 100%, e.g., between 0.5 and 50%, between 1-30%, between 5-80%, at least 80% (w/w) active ingredient.
[0834]
Tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines can be formulated using one or more excipients to: increase stability; increase cell transfection; permit the sustained or delayed release (e.g., from a depot formulation); alter the biodistribution (e.g., target to specific tissues or cell types); increase the translation of encoded protein in vivo; and/or alter the release profile of encoded protein (antigen) in vivo. In addition to traditional excipients such as any and all solvents, dispersion media, diluents, or other liquid vehicles, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, excipients can include, without limitation, lipidoids, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, polymers, lipoplexes, core-shell nanoparticles, peptides, proteins, cells transfected with tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines (e.g., for transplantation into a subject), hyaluronidase, nanoparticle mimics and combinations thereof.
Stabilizing Elements
[0835]
Naturally-occurring eukaryotic mRNA molecules have been found to contain stabilizing elements, including, but not limited to untranslated regions (UTR) at their 5′-end (5′UTR) and/or at their 3′-end (3′UTR), in addition to other structural features, such as a 5′-cap structure or a 3′-poly(A) tail. Both the 5′UTR and the 3′UTR are typically transcribed from the genomic DNA and are elements of the premature mRNA. Characteristic structural features of mature mRNA, such as the 5′-cap and the 3′-poly(A) tail are usually added to the transcribed (premature) mRNA during mRNA processing. The 3′-poly(A) tail is typically a stretch of adenine nucleotides added to the 3′-end of the transcribed mRNA. It can comprise up to about 400 adenine nucleotides. In some embodiments the length of the 3′-poly(A) tail may be an essential element with respect to the stability of the individual mRNA.
[0836]
In some embodiments the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine may include one or more stabilizing elements. Stabilizing elements may include for instance a histone stem-loop. A stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), a 32 kDa protein has been identified. It is associated with the histone stem-loop at the 3′-end of the histone messages in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Its expression level is regulated by the cell cycle; it peaks during the S-phase, when histone mRNA levels are also elevated. The protein has been shown to be essential for efficient 3′-end processing of histone pre-mRNA by the U7 snRNP. SLBP continues to be associated with the stem-loop after processing, and then stimulates the translation of mature histone mRNAs into histone proteins in the cytoplasm. The RNA binding domain of SLBP is conserved through metazoa and protozoa; its binding to the histone stem-loop depends on the structure of the loop. The minimum binding site includes at least three nucleotides 5′ and two nucleotides 3′ relative to the stem-loop.
[0837]
In some embodiments, the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines include a coding region, at least one histone stem-loop, and optionally, a poly(A) sequence or polyadenylation signal. The poly(A) sequence or polyadenylation signal generally should enhance the expression level of the encoded protein. The encoded protein, in some embodiments, is not a histone protein, a reporter protein (e.g. Luciferase, GFP, EGFP, β-Galactosidase, EGFP), or a marker or selection protein (e.g. alpha-Globin, Galactokinase and Xanthine:guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (GPT)).
[0838]
In some embodiments, the combination of a poly(A) sequence or polyadenylation signal and at least one histone stem-loop, even though both represent alternative mechanisms in nature, acts synergistically to increase the protein expression beyond the level observed with either of the individual elements. It has been found that the synergistic effect of the combination of poly(A) and at least one histone stem-loop does not depend on the order of the elements or the length of the poly(A) sequence.
[0839]
In some embodiments, the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine does not comprise a histone downstream element (HDE). “Histone downstream element” (HDE) includes a purine-rich polynucleotide stretch of approximately 15 to 20 nucleotides 3′ of naturally occurring stem-loops, representing the binding site for the U7 snRNA, which is involved in processing of histone pre-mRNA into mature histone mRNA. Ideally, the inventive nucleic acid does not include an intron.
[0840]
In some embodiments, the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine may or may not contain an enhancer and/or promoter sequence, which may be modified or unmodified or which may be activated or inactivated. In some embodiments, the histone stem-loop is generally derived from histone genes, and includes an intramolecular base pairing of two neighbored partially or entirely reverse complementary sequences separated by a spacer, including (e.g., consisting of) a short sequence, which forms the loop of the structure. The unpaired loop region is typically unable to base pair with either of the stem loop elements. It occurs more often in RNA, as is a key component of many RNA secondary structures, but may be present in single-stranded DNA as well. Stability of the stem-loop structure generally depends on the length, number of mismatches or bulges, and base composition of the paired region. In some embodiments, wobble base pairing (non-Watson-Crick base pairing) may result. In some embodiments, the at least one histone stem-loop sequence comprises a length of 15 to 45 nucleotides.
[0841]
In other embodiments the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine may have one or more AU-rich sequences removed. These sequences, sometimes referred to as AURES, are destabilizing sequences found in the 3′UTR. The AURES may be removed from the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines. Alternatively the AURES may remain in the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine.
Nanoparticle Formulations
[0842]
In some embodiments, tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines are formulated in a nanoparticle. In some embodiments, tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines are formulated in a lipid nanoparticle. In some embodiments, tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccines are formulated in a lipid-polycation complex, referred to as a cationic lipid nanoparticle. As a non-limiting example, the polycation may include a cationic peptide or a polypeptide such as, but not limited to, polylysine, polyornithine and/or polyarginine. In some embodiments, tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines are formulated in a lipid nanoparticle that includes a non-cationic lipid such as, but not limited to, cholesterol or dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE).
[0843]
A lipid nanoparticle formulation may be influenced by, but not limited to, the selection of the cationic lipid component, the degree of cationic lipid saturation, the nature of the PEGylation, ratio of all components and biophysical parameters such as size. In one example by Semple et al. (Nature Biotech. 2010 28:172-176), the lipid nanoparticle formulation is composed of 57.1% cationic lipid, 7.1% dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 34.3% cholesterol, and 1.4% PEG-c-DMA. As another example, changing the composition of the cationic lipid can more effectively deliver siRNA to various antigen presenting cells (Basha et al. Mol Ther. 2011 19:2186-2200).
[0844]
In some embodiments, lipid nanoparticle formulations may comprise 35 to 45% cationic lipid, 40% to 50% cationic lipid, 50% to 60% cationic lipid and/or 55% to 65% cationic lipid. In some embodiments, the ratio of lipid to RNA (e.g., mRNA) in lipid nanoparticles may be 5:1 to 20:1, 10:1 to 25:1, 15:1 to 30:1 and/or at least 30:1.
[0845]
In some embodiments, the ratio of PEG in the lipid nanoparticle formulations may be increased or decreased and/or the carbon chain length of the PEG lipid may be modified from C14 to C18 to alter the pharmacokinetics and/or biodistribution of the lipid nanoparticle formulations. As a non-limiting example, lipid nanoparticle formulations may contain 0.5% to 3.0%, 1.0% to 3.5%, 1.5% to 4.0%, 2.0% to 4.5%, 2.5% to 5.0% and/or 3.0% to 6.0% of the lipid molar ratio of PEG-c-DOMG (R-3-[(ω-methoxy-poly(ethyleneglycol)2000)carbamoyl)]-1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-amine) (also referred to herein as PEG-DOMG) as compared to the cationic lipid, DSPC and cholesterol. In some embodiments, the PEG-c-DOMG may be replaced with a PEG lipid such as, but not limited to, PEG-DSG (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycerol, methoxypolyethylene glycol), PEG-DMG (1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol) and/or PEG-DPG (1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol, methoxypolyethylene glycol). The cationic lipid may be selected from any lipid known in the art such as, but not limited to, DLin-MC3-DMA, DLin-DMA, C12-200 and DLin-KC2-DMA.
[0846]
In some embodiments, a tropical disease RNA (e.g. mRNA) vaccine formulation is a nanoparticle that comprises at least one lipid. The lipid may be selected from, but is not limited to, DLin-DMA, DLin-K-DMA, 98N12-5, C12-200, DLin-MC3-DMA, DLin-KC2-DMA, DODMA, PLGA, PEG, PEG-DMG, PEGylated lipids and amino alcohol lipids. In some embodiments, the lipid may be a cationic lipid such as, but not limited to, DLin-DMA, DLin-D-DMA, DLin-MC3-DMA, DLin-KC2-DMA, DODMA and amino alcohol lipids. The amino alcohol cationic lipid may be the lipids described in and/or made by the methods described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US20130150625, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. As a non-limiting example, the cationic lipid may be 2-amino-3-[(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dien-1-yloxy]-2-{[(9Z,2Z)-octadeca-9,12-dien-1-yloxy]methyl}propan-1-ol (Compound 1 in US20130150625); 2-amino-3-[(9Z)-octadec-9-en-1-yloxy]-2-{[(9Z)-octadec-9-en-1-yloxy]methyl}propan-1-ol (Compound 2 in US20130150625); 2-amino-3-[(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dien-1-yloxy]-2-[(octyloxy)methyl]propan-1-ol (Compound 3 in US20130150625); and 2-(dimethylamino)-3-[(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dien-1-yloxy]-2-{[(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dien-1-yloxy]methyl}propan-1-ol (Compound 4 in US20130150625); or any pharmaceutically acceptable salt or stereoisomer thereof.

The RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines of the disclosure can be formulated using one or more liposomes, lipoplexes, or lipid nanoparticles. In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccines include liposomes. Liposomes are artificially-prepared vesicles which may primarily be composed of a lipid bilayer and may be used as a delivery vehicle for the administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical formulations. Liposomes can be of different sizes such as, but not limited to, a multilamellar vesicle (MLV) which may be hundreds of nanometers in diameter and may contain a series of concentric bilayers separated by narrow aqueous compartments, a small unicellular vesicle (SUV) which may be smaller than 50 nm in diameter, and a large unilamellar vesicle (LUV) which may be between 50 and 500 nm in diameter. Liposome design may include, but is not limited to, opsonins or ligands in order to improve the attachment of liposomes to unhealthy tissue or to activate events such as, but not limited to, endocytosis. Liposomes may contain a low or a high pH in order to improve the delivery of the pharmaceutical formulations.
[0870]
The formation of liposomes may depend on the physicochemical characteristics such as, but not limited to, the pharmaceutical formulation entrapped and the liposomal ingredients, the nature of the medium in which the lipid vesicles are dispersed, the effective concentration of the entrapped substance and its potential toxicity, any additional processes involved during the application and/or delivery of the vesicles, the optimization size, polydispersity and the shelf-life of the vesicles for the intended application, and the batch-to-batch reproducibility and possibility of large-scale production of safe and efficient liposomal products.

Lipid nanoparticle formulations may be improved by replacing the cationic lipid with a biodegradable cationic lipid which is known as a rapidly eliminated lipid nanoparticle (reLNP). Ionizable cationic lipids, such as, but not limited to, DLinDMA, DLin-KC2-DMA, and DLin-MC3-DMA, have been shown to accumulate in plasma and tissues over time and may be a potential source of toxicity. The rapid metabolism of the rapidly eliminated lipids can improve the tolerability and therapeutic index of the lipid nanoparticles by an order of magnitude from a 1 mg/kg dose to a 10 mg/kg dose in rat. Inclusion of an enzymatically degraded ester linkage can improve the degradation and metabolism profile of the cationic component, while still maintaining the activity of the reLNP formulation. The ester linkage can be internally located within the lipid chain or it may be terminally located at the terminal end of the lipid chain. The internal ester linkage may replace any carbon in the lipid chain.
[0913]
In some embodiments, the internal ester linkage may be located on either side of the saturated carbon.

Lipid nanoparticles may be engineered to alter the surface properties of particles so the lipid nanoparticles may penetrate the mucosal barrier. Mucus is located on mucosal tissue such as, but not limited to, oral (e.g., the buccal and esophageal membranes and tonsil tissue), ophthalmic, gastrointestinal (e.g., stomach, small intestine, large intestine, colon, rectum), nasal, respiratory (e.g., nasal, pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial membranes), genital (e.g., vaginal, cervical and urethral membranes). Nanoparticles larger than 10-200 nm which are preferred for higher drug encapsulation efficiency and the ability to provide the sustained delivery of a wide array of drugs have been thought to be too large to rapidly diffuse through mucosal barriers. Mucus is continuously secreted, shed, discarded or digested and recycled so most of the trapped particles may be removed from the mucosa tissue within seconds or within a few hours. Large polymeric nanoparticles (200 nm-500 nm in diameter) which have been coated densely with a low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) diffused through mucus only 4- to 6-fold lower than the same particles diffusing in water (Lai et al.

Tropical Disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) Vaccine Formulations and Methods of Use
[1123]
Some aspects of the present disclosure provide formulations of the tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine, wherein the RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine is formulated in an effective amount to produce an antigen specific immune response in a subject (e.g., production of antibodies specific to an Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide). An “effective amount” is a dose of an RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine effective to produce an antigen-specific immune response. Also provided herein are methods of inducing an antigen-specific immune response in a subject.
[1124]
In some embodiments, the antigen-specific immune response is characterized by measuring an anti-Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in a subject administered a tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine as provided herein. An antibody titer is a measurement of the amount of antibodies within a subject, for example, antibodies that are specific to a particular antigen (e.g., an Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide) or epitope of an antigen. Antibody titer is typically expressed as the inverse of the greatest dilution that provides a positive result. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a common assay for determining antibody titers, for example.
[1125]
In some embodiments, an antibody titer is used to assess whether a subject has had an infection or to determine whether immunizations are required. In some embodiments, an antibody titer is used to determine the strength of an autoimmune response, to determine whether a booster immunization is needed, to determine whether a previous vaccine was effective, and to identify any recent or prior infections. In accordance with the present disclosure, an antibody titer may be used to determine the strength of an immune response induced in a subject by the tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine.
[1126]
In some embodiments, an anti-antigenic polypeptide (e.g., an anti-Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide) antibody titer produced in a subject is increased by at least 1 log relative to a control. For example, anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in a subject may be increased by at least 1.5, at least 2, at least 2.5, or at least 3 log relative to a control. In some embodiments, the anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in the subject is increased by 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 or 3 log relative to a control. In some embodiments, the anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in the subject is increased by 1-3 log relative to a control. For example, the anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in a subject may be increased by 1-1.5, 1-2, 1-2.5, 1-3, 1.5-2, 1.5-2.5, 1.5-3, 2-2.5, 2-3, or 2.5-3 log relative to a control.
[1127]
In some embodiments, the anti-antigenic polypeptide (e.g., an anti-Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide) antibody titer produced in a subject is increased at least 2 times relative to a control. For example, the anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in a subject may be increased at least 3 times, at least 4 times, at least 5 times, at least 6 times, at least 7 times, at least 8 times, at least 9 times, or at least 10 times relative to a control. In some embodiments, the anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in the subject is increased 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 times relative to a control. In some embodiments, the anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in a subject is increased 2-10 times relative to a control. For example, the anti-antigenic polypeptide antibody titer produced in a subject may be increased 2-10, 2-9, 2-8, 2-7, 2-6, 2-5, 2-4, 2-3, 3-10, 3-9, 3-8, 3-7, 3-6, 3-5, 3-4, 4-10, 4-9, 4-8, 4-7, 4-6, 4-5, 5-10, 5-9, 5-8, 5-7, 5-6, 6-10, 6-9, 6-8, 6-7, 7-10, 7-9, 7-8, 8-10, 8-9, or 9-10 times relative to a control.
[1128]
A control, in some embodiments, is the anti-antigenic polypeptide (e.g., an anti-Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide) antibody titer produced in a subject who has not been administered a tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, a control is an anti-antigenic polypeptide (e.g., an anti-Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide) antibody titer produced in a subject who has been administered a live attenuated Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV vaccine. An attenuated vaccine is a vaccine produced by reducing the virulence of a viable (live) virus. An attenuated virus is altered in a manner that renders it harmless or less virulent relative to a live, unmodified virus. In some embodiments, a control is an anti-antigenic polypeptide (e.g., an anti-Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide) antibody titer produced in a subject administered inactivated Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV vaccine.

Recombinant protein vaccines typically include protein antigens that either have been produced in a heterologous expression system (e.g., bacteria or yeast) or purified from large amounts of the pathogenic organism. In some embodiments, a control is an anti-antigenic polypeptide (e.g., an anti-Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptide) antibody titer produced in a subject who has been administered an Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine.
[1129]
In some embodiments, an effective amount of a tropical disease RNA (e.g., mRNA) vaccine is a dose that is reduced compared to the standard of care dose of a recombinant Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV protein vaccine. A “standard of care,” as provided herein, refers to a medical or psychological treatment guideline and can be general or specific. “Standard of care” specifies appropriate treatment based on scientific evidence and collaboration between medical professionals involved in the treatment of a given condition. It is the diagnostic and treatment process that a physician/clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness or clinical circumstance. A “standard of care dose,” as provided herein, refers to the dose of a recombinant or purified Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV protein vaccine, or a live attenuated or inactivated Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV vaccine, that a physician/clinician or other medical professional would administer to a subject to treat or prevent Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV, or a related condition, while following the standard of care guideline for treating or preventing Malaria (e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae and/or P. ovale), JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV, or a related condition.

EXAMPLES
Example 1: Manufacture of Polynucleotides
[1137]
According to the present disclosure, the manufacture of polynucleotides and/or parts or regions thereof may be accomplished utilizing the methods taught in International Publication WO2014/152027, entitled “Manufacturing Methods for Production of RNA Transcripts,” the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[1138]
Purification methods may include those taught in International Publication WO2014/152030 and International Publication WO2014/152031, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[1139]
Detection and characterization methods of the polynucleotides may be performed as taught in International Publication WO2014/144039, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[1140]
Characterization of the polynucleotides of the disclosure may be accomplished using polynucleotide mapping, reverse transcriptase sequencing, charge distribution analysis, detection of RNA impurities, or any combination of two or more of the foregoing. “Characterizing” comprises determining the RNA transcript sequence, determining the purity of the RNA transcript, or determining the charge heterogeneity of the RNA transcript, for example. Such methods are taught in, for example, International Publication WO2014/144711 and International Publication WO2014/144767, the content of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Example 2: Chimeric Polynucleotide Synthesis
[1141]
According to the present disclosure, two regions or parts of a chimeric polynucleotide may be joined or ligated using triphosphate chemistry. A first region or part of 100 nucleotides or less is chemically synthesized with a 5′ monophosphate and terminal 3′desOH or blocked OH, for example. If the region is longer than 80 nucleotides, it may be synthesized as two strands for ligation.
[1142]
If the first region or part is synthesized as a non-positionally modified region or part using in vitro transcription (IVT), conversion the 5′monophosphate with subsequent capping of the 3′ terminus may follow.
[1143]
Monophosphate protecting groups may be selected from any of those known in the art.
[1144]
The second region or part of the chimeric polynucleotide may be synthesized using either chemical synthesis or IVT methods. IVT methods may include an RNA polymerase that can utilize a primer with a modified cap. Alternatively, a cap of up to 130 nucleotides may be chemically synthesized and coupled to the IVT region or part.
[1145]
For ligation methods, ligation with DNA T4 ligase, followed by treatment with DNase should readily avoid concatenation.
[1146]
The entire chimeric polynucleotide need not be manufactured with a phosphate-sugar backbone. If one of the regions or parts encodes a polypeptide, then such region or part may comprise a phosphate-sugar backbone.
[1147]
Ligation is then performed using any known click chemistry, orthoclick chemistry, solulink, or other bioconjugate chemistries known to those in the art.
[1148]
Synthetic Route
[1149]
The chimeric polynucleotide may be made using a series of starting segments. Such segments include:
[1150]
(a) a capped and protected 5′ segment comprising a normal 3′OH (SEG. 1)
[1151]
(b) a 5′ triphosphate segment, which may include the coding region of a polypeptide and a normal 3′OH (SEG. 2)
[1152]
(c) a 5′ monophosphate segment for the 3′ end of the chimeric polynucleotide (e.g., the tail) comprising cordycepin or no 3′OH (SEG. 3)
[1153]
After synthesis (chemical or IVT), segment 3 (SEG. 3) may be treated with cordycepin and then with pyrophosphatase to create the 5′ monophosphate.
[1154]
Segment 2 (SEG. 2) may then be ligated to SEG. 3 using RNA ligase. The ligated polynucleotide is then purified and treated with pyrophosphatase to cleave the diphosphate. The treated SEG.2-SEG. 3 construct may then be purified and SEG. 1 is ligated to the 5′ terminus. A further purification step of the chimeric polynucleotide may be performed.
[1155]
Where the chimeric polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide, the ligated or joined segments may be represented as: 5′UTR (SEG. 1), open reading frame or ORF (SEG. 2) and 3′UTR+PolyA (SEG. 3).
[1156]
The yields of each step may be as much as 90-95%.
Example 3: PCR for cDNA Production
[1157]
PCR procedures for the preparation of cDNA may be performed using 2×KAPA HIFI™ HotStart ReadyMix by Kapa Biosystems (Woburn, Mass.). This system includes 2× KAPA ReadyMix 12.5 μl; Forward Primer (10 μM) 0.75 μl; Reverse Primer (10 μM) 0.75 μl; Template cDNA 100 ng; and dH2O diluted to 25.0 μl. The reaction conditions may be at 95° C. for 5 min. The reaction may be performed for 25 cycles of 98° C. for 20 sec, then 58° C. for 15 sec, then 72° C. for 45 sec, then 72° C. for 5 min, then 4° C. to termination.
[1158]
The reaction may be cleaned up using Invitrogen's PURELINK™ PCR Micro Kit (Carlsbad, Calif.) per manufacturer's instructions (up to 5 μg). Larger reactions may require a cleanup using a product with a larger capacity. Following the cleanup, the cDNA may be quantified using the NANODROP™ and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm that the cDNA is the expected size. The cDNA may then be submitted for sequencing analysis before proceeding to the in vitro transcription reaction.
Example 4: In Vitro Transcription (IVT)
[1159]
The in vitro transcription reaction generates RNA polynucleotides. Such polynucleotides may comprise a region or part of the polynucleotides of the disclosure, including chemically modified RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides. The chemically modified RNA polynucleotides can be uniformly modified polynucleotides. The in vitro transcription reaction utilizes a custom mix of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). The NTPs may comprise chemically modified NTPs, or a mix of natural and chemically modified NTPs, or natural NTPs.
[1160]
A typical in vitro transcription reaction includes the following:
1) Template cDNA 1.0 μg
2) 10× transcription buffer 2.0 μl
(400 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 190 mM
MgCl2, 50 mM DTT, 10 mM
Spermidine)
3) Custom NTPs (25 mM each) 0.2 μl
4) RNase Inhibitor 20 U
5) T7 RNA polymerase 3000 U
6) dH 20 up to 20.0 μl. and
7) Incubation at 37° C. for 3 hr-5 hrs.
[1161]
The crude IVT mix may be stored at 4° C. overnight for cleanup the next day. 1 U of RNase-free DNase may then be used to digest the original template. After 15 minutes of incubation at 37° C., the mRNA may be purified using Ambion's MEGACLEAR™ Kit (Austin, Tex.) following the manufacturer's instructions. This kit can purify up to 500 μg of RNA. Following the cleanup, the RNA polynucleotide may be quantified using the NANODROP™ and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the RNA polynucleotide is the proper size and that no degradation of the RNA has occurred.
Example 5: Enzymatic Capping
[1162]
Capping of a RNA polynucleotide is performed as follows where the mixture includes: IVT RNA 60 μg-180 μg and dH2O up to 72 μl. The mixture is incubated at 65° C. for 5 minutes to denature RNA, and then is transferred immediately to ice.
[1163]
The protocol then involves the mixing of 10× Capping Buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mM KCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2) (10.0 μl); 20 mM GTP (5.0 μl); 20 mM S-Adenosyl Methionine (2.5 μl); RNase Inhibitor (100 U); 2′-O-Methyltransferase (400U); Vaccinia capping enzyme (Guanylyl transferase) (40 U); dH2O (Up to 28 μl); and incubation at 37° C. for 30 minutes for 60 μg RNA or up to 2 hours for 180 μg of RNA.
[1164]
The RNA polynucleotide may then be purified using Ambion's MEGACLEAR™ Kit (Austin, Tex.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Following the cleanup, the RNA may be quantified using the NANODROP™ (ThermoFisher, Waltham, Mass.) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the RNA polynucleotide is the proper size and that no degradation of the RNA has occurred. The RNA polynucleotide product may also be sequenced by running a reverse-transcription-PCR to generate the cDNA for sequencing.
Example 6: PolyA Tailing Reaction
[1165]
Without a poly-T in the cDNA, a poly-A tailing reaction must be performed before cleaning the final product. This is done by mixing capped IVT RNA (100 μl); RNase Inhibitor (20 U); 10× Tailing Buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM MgCl2) (12.0 μl); 20 mM ATP (6.0 μl); Poly-A Polymerase (20 U); dH2O up to 123.5 μl and incubation at 37° C. for 30 min. If the poly-A tail is already in the transcript, then the tailing reaction may be skipped and proceed directly to cleanup with Ambion's MEGACLEAR™ kit (Austin, Tex.) (up to 500 μg). Poly-A Polymerase may be a recombinant enzyme expressed in yeast.
[1166]
It should be understood that the processivity or integrity of the polyA tailing reaction may not always result in an exact size polyA tail. Hence, polyA tails of approximately between 40-200 nucleotides, e.g., about 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 150-165, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164 or 165 are within the scope of the present disclosure.
Example 7: Natural 5′ Caps and 5′ Cap Analogues
[1167]
5′-capping of polynucleotides may be completed concomitantly during the in vitro-transcription reaction using the following chemical RNA cap analogs to generate the 5′-guanosine cap structure according to manufacturer protocols: 3′-O-Me-m7G(5)ppp(5′) G [the ARCA cap]; G(5′)ppp(5′)A; G(5′)ppp(5′)G; m7G(5′)ppp(5′)A; m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.). 5′-capping of modified RNA may be completed post-transcriptionally using a Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme to generate the “Cap 0” structure: m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.). Cap 1 structure may be generated using both Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme and a 2′-O methyl-transferase to generate: m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G-2′-O-methyl. Cap 2 structure may be generated from the Cap 1 structure followed by the 2′-O-methylation of the 5′-antepenultimate nucleotide using a 2′-O methyl-transferase. Cap 3 structure may be generated from the Cap 2 structure followed by the 2′-O-methylation of the 5′-preantepenultimate nucleotide using a 2′-O methyl-transferase. Enzymes are preferably derived from a recombinant source.
[1168]
When transfected into mammalian cells, the modified mRNAs have a stability of between 12-18 hours or more than 18 hours, e.g., 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 or greater than 72 hours.
Example 8: Capping Assays
Protein Expression Assay
[1169]
Polynucleotides (e.g., mRNA) encoding a polypeptide, containing any of the caps taught herein, can be transfected into cells at equal concentrations. The amount of protein secreted into the culture medium can be assayed by ELISA at 6, 12, 24 and/or 36 hours post-transfection. Synthetic polynucleotides that secrete higher levels of protein into the medium correspond to a synthetic polynucleotide with a higher translationally-competent cap structure.
Purity Analysis Synthesis
[1170]
RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide, containing any of the caps taught herein can be compared for purity using denaturing Agarose-Urea gel electrophoresis or HPLC analysis. RNA polynucleotides with a single, consolidated band by electrophoresis correspond to the higher purity product compared to polynucleotides with multiple bands or streaking bands. Chemically modified RNA polynucleotides with a single HPLC peak also correspond to a higher purity product. The capping reaction with a higher efficiency provides a more pure polynucleotide population.
Cytokine Analysis
[1171]
RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide, containing any of the caps taught herein can be transfected into cells at multiple concentrations. The amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IFN-beta, secreted into the culture medium can be assayed by ELISA at 6, 12, 24 and/or 36 hours post-transfection. RNA polynucleotides resulting in the secretion of higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the medium correspond to a polynucleotides containing an immune-activating cap structure.
Capping Reaction Efficiency
[1172]
RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide, containing any of the caps taught herein can be analyzed for capping reaction efficiency by LC-MS after nuclease treatment. Nuclease treatment of capped polynucleotides yield a mixture of free nucleotides and the capped 5′-5-triphosphate cap structure detectable by LC-MS. The amount of capped product on the LC-MS spectra can be expressed as a percent of total polynucleotide from the reaction and correspond to capping reaction efficiency. The cap structure with a higher capping reaction efficiency has a higher amount of capped product by LC-MS.
Example 9: Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of Modified RNA or RT PCR Products
[1173]
Individual RNA polynucleotides (200-400 ng in a 20 μl volume) or reverse transcribed PCR products (200-400 ng) may be loaded into a well on a non-denaturing 1.2% Agarose E-Gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and run for 12-15 minutes, according to the manufacturer protocol.
Example 10: NANODROP™ Modified RNA Quantification and UV Spectral Data
[1174]
Chemically modified RNA polynucleotides in TE buffer (1 μl) are used for NANODROP™ UV absorbance readings to quantitate the yield of each polynucleotide from an chemical synthesis or in vitro transcription reaction.
Example 11: Formulation of Modified mRNA Using Lipidoids
[1175]
RNA (e.g., mRNA) polynucleotides may be formulated for in vitro experiments by mixing the polynucleotides with the lipidoid at a set ratio prior to addition to cells. In vivo formulation may require the addition of extra ingredients to facilitate circulation throughout the body. To test the ability of these lipidoids to form particles suitable for in vivo work, a standard formulation process used for siRNA-lipidoid formulations may be used as a starting point. After formation of the particle, polynucleotide is added and allowed to integrate with the complex. The encapsulation efficiency is determined using a standard dye exclusion assays.
Example 12: Immunogenicity Study
[1176]
The instant study is designed to test the immunogenicity in mice of candidate Malaria vaccines comprising a mRNA polynucleotide encoding CS protein, LSA1, MSP1, AMA1, TRAP or a combination thereof obtained from Plasmodium.
[1177]
Mice are immunized intramuscularly (IM), or intradermally (ID) with mRNA encoding CS protein, LSA1, MSP1, TRAP and AMA1. Up to three immunizations are given at 3-week intervals (i.e., at weeks 0, 3, and 6), and sera are collected after each immunization until weeks 33-51. Serum antibody titers against CS protein, LSA1, MSP1 and AMA1 are determined by ELISA. Responses against Plasmodium sporozoites, asexual blood-stage parasites, and gametocytes were determined by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). T cell responses were analyzed by Elispot using splenocytes from immunized mice and stimulated with peptide pools from the relevant antigens.
Example 13: Plasmodium Non Human Primate Challenge
[1178]
The instant study is designed to test the efficacy in simians of candidate Malaria vaccines against a lethal challenge using a Malaria vaccine comprising mRNA encoding CS protein, LSA1, MSP1, AMA1, TRAP or a combination thereof obtained from Plasmodium. Simians are challenged with a lethal dose of Plasmodium.
[1179]
Simians are immunized intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID) at week 0, week 3 and week 6 with candidate Malaria vaccines.
[1180]
Serum antibody titers against CS protein, LSA1, MSP1 and AMA1 are determined by ELISA. Responses against Plasmodium sporozoites, asexual blood-stage parasites, and gametocytes were determined by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). T cell responses were analyzed by Elispot using PBMCs from immunized primates and stimulated with peptide pools from the relevant antigens.
[1181]
In experiments where a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation is used, the formulation may include a cationic lipid, non-cationic lipid, PEG lipid and structural lipid in the ratios 50:10:1.5:38.5. The cationic lipid may be DLin-KC2-DMA (50 mol %), the non-cationic lipid may be DSPC (10 mol %), the PEG lipid may be PEG-DOMG (1.5 mol %) and the structural lipid may be cholesterol (38.5 mol %), for example.
Example 14: Plasmodium Human Challenge
[1182]
The instant study is designed to test the efficacy in human subjects of candidate Malaria vaccines against an attenuated challenge (Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) Study) using a Malaria vaccine comprising mRNA encoding CS protein, LSA1, MSP1, AMA1, TRAP or a combination thereof obtained from Plasmodium. Subjects are challenged with an attenuated (non-lethal) dose of Plasmodium.
[1183]
Subjects are immunized intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID) at week 0 and week 3 with candidate Malaria vaccines. Serum is tested for microneutralization (see Example 16). The subjects are then challenged with an attenuated dose of Plasmodium on week 7 via IV, IM or ID. Endpoint is day 13 post infection. Body temperature and weight are assessed and recorded daily.
[1184]
In experiments where a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation is used, the formulation may include a cationic lipid, non-cationic lipid, PEG lipid and structural lipid in the ratios 50:10:1.5:38.5. The cationic lipid may be DLin-KC2-DMA (50 mol %), the non-cationic lipid may be DSPC (10 mol %), the PEG lipid may be PEG-DOMG (1.5 mol %) and the structural lipid may be cholesterol (38.5 mol %), for example.
Example 15: Microneutralization Assay
[1185]
Nine serial 2-fold dilutions (1:50-1:12,800) of simian or human serum are made in 50 μl virus growth medium (VGM) with trypsin in 96 well microtiter plates. Fifty microliters of Plasmodium are added to the serum dilutions and allowed to incubate for 60 minutes at room temperature (RT). Positive control wells of Plasmodium without sera and negative control wells without Plasmodium or sera are included in triplicate on each plate. While the serum-Plasmodium mixtures incubate, a single cell suspension of cells is prepared by trypsinizing (Gibco 0.5% bovine pancrease trypsin in EDTA) a confluent monolayer, and suspended cells are transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube, topped with sterile PBS and gently mixed. The cells are then pelleted at 200 g for 5 minutes, supernatant aspirated and cells resuspended in PBS. This procedure is repeated once and the cells are resuspended at a concentration of 3×105/ml in VGM with porcine trypsin. Then, 100 μl of cells are added to the serum-virus mixtures and the plates incubated at 35° C. in CO2 for 5 days. The plates are fixed with 80% acetone in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 minutes at RT, air dried and then blocked for 30 minutes containing PBS with 0.5% gelatin and 2% FCS. An antibody to CS protein, LSA1, MSP1, AMA1 or TRAP is diluted in PBS with 0.5% gelatin/2% FCS/0.5% Tween 20 and incubated at RT for 2 hours. Wells are washed and horse radish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG added, followed by another 2 hour incubation. After washing, 0-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride is added and the neutralization titer is defined as the titer of serum that reduced color development by 50% compared to the positive control wells.
Example 16: JEV Immunogenicity Study
[1186]
This study was designed to test the immunogenicity of JEV prME mRNA vaccines in Balb/c mice. Mice were 6-8 weeks old.
[1187]
Mice were immunized intramuscularly at three different doses (10 μg, 2 μg and 0.5 μg). All mice were given two doses of the vaccine, one at day 0 and another at day 28. Serum was collected at days 0 and 56, and a plaque reduction neutralization test was used to quantify neutralizing antibody titer. The concentration of serum to reduce the number of plaques in the assay by 50%, compared to the serum free virus, denoted as PRNT50 was used as a measure of neutralizing antibodies and level of protection against virus.
[1188]
Results of this study is shown in FIG. 1. A PRNT50 titer of greater than 1:10 is considered protective. JEV mRNA vaccine at 10 μg doses results in a very high titer, indicative of a high potency vaccine.
Example 17: Immunogenicity Cross-Neutralization Study
[1189]
The instant study is designed to test the immunogenicity and cross-neutralization in mice of candidate combination vaccines comprising a mRNA polynucleotide encoding antigenic polypeptides (e.g., envelope proteins) obtained from Plasmodium, JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV.
[1190]
Mice are immunized intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), or intradermally (ID) with candidate combination vaccines. A total of four immunizations are given at 3-week intervals (at weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9), and sera are collected after each immunization until weeks 33-51. Serum antibody titers against envelope proteins are determined by ELISA. Sera collected from each mouse during weeks 10-16 are pooled, and total IgGs are purified by using ammonium sulfate (Sigma) precipitation followed by DEAE (Pierce) batch purification. Following dialysis against PBS, the purified antibodies are used for immunoelectron microscopy, antibody-affinity testing, and an in vitro protection assay.
Example 18: Immunogenicity Studies for Combination RNA Vaccine
[1191]
BALB/C mice are immunized with mRNA encoded Plasmodium, JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptides, for example, as shown in Table 7 below and according to the following dosing/bleeding schedule: prime dose on day 0, boost dose on day 28, bleeding on days 0, 28, 42 and 56.
[1192]
The mice are administered a combination vaccine, combining two or more of the Plasmodium, JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV antigenic polypeptides, such that all possible combinations are tested. Animals are challenged at day 56 with a second dose of any one of the antigenic polypeptides included in the original dose.
[1193]
An efficacy study using mRNA encoded West Nile prMEs and Japanese Encephalitis prMEs antigens is also performed according to the following schedule:
[1194]
Non-human primates are also immunized with mRNA encoded antigen using similar schedules shown in Tables 7 and 8. The animals are tested for immunogenicity to Plasmodium, JEV, WNV, EEEV, VEEV, SINV, CHIKV, DENV, ZIKV and/or YFV and combinations thereof.
Example 19. YFV Immunogenicity Studies
[1195]
The instant study is designed to test the immunogenicity in Balb/c mice of candidate yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccines comprising a mRNA polynucleotide encoding YFV prME. Four groups of Balb/c mice (n=5) are immunized intramuscularly (IM) with 10 μg (n=2) or 2 μg (n=2) of the candidate vaccine. One group of mice is administered PBS intramuscularly as a control. All mice are administered an initial dose of vaccine (Groups 1-4) or PBS (Group 5) on Day 0, and then the mice in Groups 1 and 3 are administered a boost dose on Day 21, while the mice in Group 5 are administered PBS on Day 21. All mice are bled on Day 41. See Table 1. Anti-Yellow fever neutralization IgG titer is determined on Day −1, Day 28 and Day 41.
Example 20. YFV Rodent Challenge
[1196]
The instant study is designed to test the efficacy in AG129 mice of candidate yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccines against a lethal challenge using a YFV vaccine comprising mRNA encoding YFV prME. Four groups of AG129 mice (n=8) are immunized intramuscularly (IM) with 10 μg (n=2) or 2 μg (n=2) of the candidate vaccine. One group of mice is administered PBS intramuscularly as a control. All mice are administered an initial dose of vaccine (Groups 1-4) or PBS (Group 5) on Day 0, and then the mice in Groups 1 and 3 are administered a boost dose on Day 21, while the mice in Group 5 are administered PBS on Day 21. All mice are challenged with a lethal dose of YFV in Day 42. All mice are then monitored for survival and weight loss. Anti-Yellow fever neutralization IgG titer is determined on Day −1, Day 28 and Day 41, and viral load is determined 5 days post challenge.
Example 21. Expression of ZIKV prME Protein in Mammalian Cells Using ZIKV mRNA Vaccine Construct
[1197]
The Zika virus (ZIKV) prME mRNA vaccine construct were tested in mammalian cells (239T cells) for the expression of ZIKV prME protein. 293T cells were plated in 24-well plates and were transfected with 2 μg of ZIKV prME mRNA using a Lipofectamine transfection reagent. The cells were incubated for the expression of the ZIKV prME proteins before they were lysed in an immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktails. Reducing agent was not added to the lysis buffer to ensure that the cellular proteins were in a non-reduced state. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 8,000×g for 20 mins to collect lysed cell precipitate. The cell precipitates were then stained with anti ZIKV human serum and goat anti-human Alexa Fluor 647. Fluorescence was detected as an indication of prME expression.
[1198]
The expression of ZIKV prME protein was also detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a flow cytometer. 293F cells (2×106 cells/ml, 30 ml) were transfected with 120 μg PEI, 1 ml of 150 mM NaCl, and 60 μg prME mRNA. Transfected cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37° C. in a shaker at 130 rpm and under 5% CO2. The cells were then washed with PBS buffer containing 2% FBS and fixed in a fixation buffer (PBS buffer containing formalin) for 20 minutes at room temperature. The fixed cells were permeabilized in a permeabilization buffer (PBS+1% Triton X100+1 μl of Golgi plug/ml of cells). The permeabilized cells were then stained with anti-ZIKV human serum (1:20 dilution) and goat anti-human Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody, before they were sorted on a flow cytometer. As shown in FIG. 2, FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, cells transfected with prME mRNA and stained with the anti-ZIKA human serum shifted to higher fluorescent intensity, indicating that prME expressed from the ZIKV mRNA vaccine constructs in the transfected cells.
Example 22. Expression, Purification and Characterization of ZIKV VLPs
[1199]
Zika virus (ZIKV) virus-like particles (VLPs) were made in HeLa cells and in HEK293T cells and purified via PEG precipitation or ultracentrifugation, respectively. Cells were cultured in culture media. Prior to transfection, cells were passaged twice in virus growth media plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to media adaptation.
[1200]
Cells were seeded the day before transfection into T-175 flask. 100 μg of prME-encoding mRNA was transfected using 100 μg pf lipofectamine as per manufacturer's protocol. 6 hours post transfection, monolayers were washed twice with 1×PBS and 20 mL of virus growth media was added. Supernatant was collected 24-48 hours post transfection by centrifugation at 2000×g for 10 mins and 0.22 μm filtration.
[1201]
For VLP purification via PEG precipitation, VLP's were concentrated using Biovision PEG precipitation kit as per manufacturer's protocol. In brief, supernatant with VLP's was mixed with PEG8000 and incubated at 4° C. for 16 hours. After incubation, mixture was centrifuged at 3000×g for 30 mins Pellet containing concentrated VLP's was collected and suspended into PBS. VLP's were further buffer exchanged into PBS (1:500) using amicon ultra 100MWCO filter. Purified samples were negative stained to show the presence of assembled VLP particles.
[1202]
Expression of prME from the vaccine mRNA constructs was demonstrated to result in the production of virus like particles (VLPs) that are expected to present to the immune system as identical to Zika virus particles. Negative stain electron micrographs of supernatants from HeLa cells transfected with mRNA encoding Zika prME showed that the virus-like particles (VLPs), purified by PEG precipitation, have highly uniform size (˜35-40 nm) and morphology. The bumpy appearance of the VLP surface appears to reflect mostly immature morphology due to expression from HeLa cells, which have very low expression of furin, a host protease that is required for maturation the viral envelope. Upon maturation, these VLPs will have an exterior structure essentially identical to wild type viral particles, thus eliciting a broad immune response to future Zika virus exposure.
[1203]
For VLP purification via ultracentrifugation, 293T cells were transfected with Zika prME mRNA as described herein. Supernatant was collected 24 hours after changing the media as described herein (30 hours post transfection). VLPs were concentrated using Biovision PEG virus precipitation kit into 500 μL volume. VLPs were further purified using a 10-50% sucrose gradient. Sample layer was seen between 20-30% sucrose layers and collected. VLPs were buffered exchanged into PBS by 1:1000 dilution using a 100MWCO amicon ultra filter. VLPs were concentrated after PEG precipitation, and ultracentrifuge-purified VLPs were analyzed for purity on a reducing SDS-PAGE gel (FIG. 4).
Example 23: ZIKV mRNA Vaccine Immunogenicity Studies
[1204]
The instant study was designed to test the immunogenicity in Balb/c mice of candidate ZIKV vaccines comprising a mRNA polynucleotide encoding ZIKV prME. Four groups of Balb/c mice (n=5) were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with 10 μg (n=2) or 2 μg (n=2) of the candidate vaccine. One group of mice was administered PBS intramuscularly as a control. All mice were administered an initial dose of vaccine (Groups 1-4) or PBS (Group 5) on Day 0, and then the mice in Groups 1 and 3 were administered a boost dose on Day 21, while the mice in Group 5 were administered PBS on Day 21. All mice were bled on Day 41. See Table 29. Anti-Zika neutralization IgG titer was determined on Day −1, Day 28 and Day 41 (FIG. 5).
[1205]
Day 42 neutralizing titers reached EC50s of 427 for 2 μg and 690 for 10 μg. The control serum in this experiment was from naturally infected immunocompromised mice (Ifnar1−/−, derived from B/6 lineage) in which high viral loads would be achieved.
Example 24: ZIKV Rodent Challenge
[1206]
The instant study was designed to test the efficacy in AG129 mice of candidate ZIKV vaccines against a lethal challenge using a ZIKV vaccine comprising mRNA encoding ZIKV prME. Four groups of AG129 mice (n=8) were immunized intramuscularly (IM) with 10 μg (n=2) or 2 μg (n=2) of the candidate vaccine. One group of mice was administered PBS intramuscularly as a control. All mice were administered an initial dose of vaccine (Groups 1-4) or PBS (Group 5) on Day 0, and then the mice in Groups 1 and 3 were administered a boost dose on Day 21, while the mice in Group 5 were administered PBS on Day 21. All mice were challenged with a lethal dose of ZIKV in Day 42. All mice were then monitored for survival and weight loss. Anti-Zika neutralization IgG titer was determined on Day −1, Day 28 and Day 41, and viral load was determined 5 days post challenge. The 10 μg dose provided 100% protection, even with a single dose, and the 2 μg dose provided 60% protection with a single dose and 90% protection with prime-boost doses (see FIGS. 7A and 7B).
[1207]
In experiments where a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation is used, the formulation may include a cationic lipid, non-cationic lipid, PEG lipid and structural lipid in the ratios 50:10:1.5:38.5. The cationic lipid may be DLin-KC2-DMA or DLin-MC3-DMA (50 mol %), the non-cationic lipid may be DSPC (10 mol %), the PEG lipid is PEG-DOMG or PEG-DMG (1.5 mol %) and the structural lipid may be cholesterol (38.5 mol %), for example.

An exemplary Dengue virus (DENV) peptide epitope may include two or more epitopes. The epitopes can be of the same sequence or different sequence and can be all T-cell epitopes, all B-cell epitopes or a combination of both. Furthermore, various end units for enhancing MHC processing of the peptides are possible.

Example 26: Dengue Virus RNA Vaccine Immunogenicity in Mice
[1211]
This study provides a preliminary analysis of the immunogenicity of a nucleic acid mRNA vaccine using a Dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 antigen in BALB/c mice. The study utilizes 44 groups of 10 BALB/c female (5) and male (5) mice (440 total, 6-8 weeks of age at study initiation, see Table 10 for design summary). In this study, construct numbers used are referenced and found in Table 28.
[1212]
Mice were vaccinated on weeks 0 and 3 via intramuscular (IM) or intradermal (ID) routes. One group remained unvaccinated and one was administered 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) live DENV2, D2Y98P isolate via intravenous (IV) injection as a positive control. Serum was collected from each mouse on weeks 1, 3, and 5; bleeds on weeks 1 and 3 were in-life samples (tail vein or submandibular bleeds) and week 5 will be a terminal (intracardiac) bleed. Individual serum samples were stored at −80° C. until analysis by neutralization or microneutralization assay. Pooled samples from each group at the week 5 time points were tested by Western blot for reactivity with viral lysate.
[1213]
Signal was detected in groups 5, 15, 39, and 44 (live virus control) by a band that appeared between 50 and 60 kDa in the Western blot data. The data suggests that a mRNA vaccine to a single dengue viral antigen can produce antibody in preliminary studies.
[1214]
In order to provide a Dengue vaccine having enhanced immunogenicity, RNA vaccines for concatemeric antigens were designed and tested according to the invention. These vaccines, which have significantly enhanced activity, in comparison to the single protein antigens described herein, are described below.
Example 27: In Silico Prediction of T Cell Epitopes for RNA Vaccine Design
[1215]
Several peptide epitopes from Dengue virus were generated and tested for antigenic activity. The peptide epitopes are designed to maximize MHC presentation. In general the process of MHC class I presentation is quite inefficient, with only 1 peptide of 10,000 degraded molecules actually being presented. Additionally the priming of CD8 T cell with APCs having insufficient densities of surface peptide/MHC class I complexes results in weak responders exhibiting impaired cytokine secretion and a decrease memory pool. Thus, the process of designing highly effective peptide epitopes is important to the immunogenicity of the ultimate vaccine.
[1216]
In silico prediction of desirable peptide epitopes was performed using Immune Epitope Database. Using this database several immunogenic Dengue T cell epitopes showing strong homology across all 4 Dengue serotypes were predicted. Examples of these epitopes are shown in FIGS. 8A-8C and 9A-9C.
Example 28: Prediction of DENV T Cell Epitopes for RNA Vaccine Design
[1217]
The design of optimized vaccination systems to prevent or treat conditions that have failed to respond to more traditional treatments or early vaccination strategies relies on the identification of the antigens or epitopes that play a role in these conditions and which the immune system can effectively target. T cell epitopes (e.g., MHC peptide binding) for the various alleles shown in Table 32 were determined using Rapid Epitope Discovery System (ProImmune REVEAL & ProVE®—see Tables 33-40 for peptides). This system is used to identify those candidate epitopes that actually cause relevant immune responses from the numerous other potential candidates identified using algorithms to predict MHC-peptide binding. The REVEAL binding assay determines the ability of each candidate peptide to bind to one or more MHC I class alleles and stabilize the MHC-peptide complex. The assay identifies the most likely immunogenic peptides in a protein sequence by comparing the binding to that of a high affinity T cell epitope and detecting the presence or absence of the native conformation of the MHC-peptide complex. The epitope peptides are further tested using the assays described herein to confirm their immunogenic activity.
Example 29: Activity Testing for Predicted Peptide Epitopes
[1218]
Exemplary peptide epitopes selected using the methods described above were further characterized. These peptide epitopes were confirmed to have activity using in vitro HLA binding assays (human lymphocyte binding assays). Peptides (9 aa peptides from the dengue antigen) were screened for their ability to bind to HLA. The analysis of the homology, affinity, frequency and design of these peptides is shown in FIGS. 8A-8C and 9A-9C.
Example 30: In Vivo Analysis of Mimectopes of Predicted Human Epitopes RNA Vaccines Methods
[1219]
IFNγ ELISpot.
[1220]
Mouse IFNγ ELISpot assays were performed using IFNγ coated Millipore IP Opaque plates according to the manufacturer's mouse IFNγ ELISPOT guidelines. Briefly, the plates were blocked using complete RPMI (R10) and incubated for 30 minutes prior to plating cells. Peptides (284-292, 408-419 or 540-548) were diluted to 5 different concentrations for stimulation at 5, -6, -7, -8, or -9 from an original stock concentration of 10 mM(−2). Mouse splenocytes (200,000-250,000 cells) were plated in appropriate wells with peptide, PMA+Ionomycin or R10 media alone. Cells were stimulated in a total volume of 125 μL per well. Plates were then incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 18-24 hrs. Plates were developed following the manufacturer's instructions. Plates were counted and quality controlled using the automated ELISPOT reader CTL ImmunoSpot/FluoroSpot.
[1221]
Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS).
[1222]
Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS). For intracellular cytokine staining, individual splenocytes, were resuspended at a concentration of 1.5×106 cells per mL. Peptides (284-292, 408-419 or 540-548) were made into 5 dilutions from a stock concentration of 10 mM(−2). The final concentrations of each peptide were −5, −6, −7, −8, or −9 in their respective wells. Cells were stimulated in a final volume of 200 μL within a 96 well culture plate. After the addition of Golgi plug (0.2 μL per well), cells were incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 5 hours. Following stimulation, cells were surface stained, fixed, washed and put at 4° C. overnight. Intracellular staining was performed the following day, resulting in full panel of Live/Dead (Invitrogen), αCD3, αCD4, αCD8, αCD45, αCCR7, αCD44, αCD25, αIL-2, αIFNγ, and αTNFα (BD Biosciences). Cells were acquired in a 96-U bottom plate using BD LSR Fortessa HTS (BD Biosciences).
Results
[1223]
The exemplary peptide epitopes selected using the methods described herein were used to produce tests mouse mimectopes of the predicted human epitopes. These mimectopes were analyzed for in vivo activity using restimulation assays during the acute phase of Dengue infection (Day 7). The methods were performed on dengue-infected IFNαβ/γ-receptor-deficient mice (AG129). Seven days post infection splenocytes were harvested and subjected to an ELISPOT assay to quantify secretion of cytokines by T cells (CD8) as described above. Briefly, the isolated splenocytes were stimulated with the test peptides and tested for T cell activation. If the peptide is an appropriate antigen, some cells would be present antigen during infection and would be capable of stimulating T cells. The methods for analyzing the T cell activation were performed as follows:
T cells (at a known concentration) were incubated with a specific antigen in a cell culture well
the activated T cells were transferred to ELISPOT plates (precoated with anti-cytokine antibody)
the cells were incubated such that cytokines could be secreted
the cells were washed off the plate and enzyme coupled secondary Ig was added
the plates were washed and substrate was added
positive spots were scored under microscope.
[1230]
The data is shown in FIGS. 10 and 11. FIGS. 10 and 11 are graphs depicting the results of an ELISPOT assay of dengue-specific peptides measuring IFN-γ (spots per million splenocytes).
[1231]
A schematic of an assay on a BLT Mouse Model (Bone Marrow/Liver/Thymus) is shown in FIG. 12. The results of a histogram analysis of human CD8 T cells stimulated with peptide epitope is also shown in FIG. 12.

Example 31: AG129 Mouse Challenge of Mimectopes of Predicted Human Epitopes from DENV2
[1232]
A study is performed on AG129 mouse using a cocktail of 2 peptide epitopes. The immunogenicity of the peptide epitopes is determined in AG129 mice against challenge with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted DENV 2 strain D2Y98P. AG129 mice, which lack IFN α/β and γ receptor signaling, injected intradermally in the footpad with 104 PFU of DENV do not survive past day 5 post-injection. AG129 mice are vaccinated via intramuscular (IM) injection with either 2 μg or 10 μg of a cocktail of 2 peptide epitopes. The vaccines are given to AG129 mice with a prime and a boost (day 0 and day 28). The positive control group is vaccinated with heat-inactivated DENV 2. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) is used as a negative control. On day 56, mice are challenged with mouse-adapted DENV 2 and monitored for 10 days for weight loss, morbidity, and mortality. Mice that display severe illness, defined as >30% weight loss, a health score of 6 or above, extreme lethargy, and/or paralysis are euthanized.
Example 32: “Humanized” DENV Peptides Mouse Immunogenicity Study
[1233]
A study analyzing immunogenicity of the peptide epitopes on humanized mice is performed. A single-dose cocktail (30 μg) containing 3 different peptide epitopes are delivered by IM route of immunization with prime and boost (day 0, day 28). A T cell (ELISPOT and ICS) characterization may be performed on Day 7, Day 28, and Day 56.
Example 33: Testing of Non-Human Primate (NHP) Mimectopes of Predicted DENV Human Epitopes
[1234]
Non-human primate (NHP) mimectopes to the human epitopes may also be developed and tested for activity in NHP assays. The NHP mimectopes are designed based on the human antigen sequence. These mimectopes may be analyzed for in vivo activity in an NHP model using, for instance, restimulation assays. Once the NHPs have been infected, immune cells may be isolated and tested for sensitivity of activation by the particular mimectopes.
Example 34: Targeting of DENV Concatemeric Constructs Using Cytoplasmic Domain of MHC I
[1235]
MHC-1_V5 concatemer constructs were developed and transfected in HeLa cells. Triple immunofluorescence using Mitotracker Red (mitochondria), anti-V5, and anti-MHC-1 antibodies plus DAPI was performed. MHC-1_V5 concatemer transfection in HeLa cells shows V5-MHC1 colocalization. MHC-1_V5 concatemer transfection also shows V5 has homogeneous cytoplasmic distribution and preferentially colocalizes with MHC1 and not with Mitotracker. These data demonstrate that the V5 concatemer with the cytoplasmic domain from MHC class I co-localizes with MHC class I expression, while the V5 concatemer without this sequence is only found in the cytoplasm following transfection in HeLa cells.
Example 35: In Vivo Analysis of DENV Concatemeric mRNA Epitope Construct
[1236]
The Dengue concatemers used in this study consist of 8 repeats of the peptide TALGATEI (SEQ ID NO: 363), a mouse CD8 T cell epitope found in the DENV2 envelope. The peptide repeats were linked via cathepsin B cleavage sites and modified with the various sequences as follows:
(1) TALGATEI (SEQ ID NO: 363) peptide concatemer with no modification
(2) TALGATEI (SEQ ID NO: 363) peptide concatemer with IgKappa signal peptide
(3) TALGATEI (SEQ ID NO: 363) peptide concatemer with PEST sequence
(4) TALGATEI (SEQ ID NO: 363) peptide concatemer with IgKappa signal peptide and PEST sequence
(5) TALGATEI (SEQ ID NO: 363) peptide concatemer with MHC class I cytoplasmic domain
(6) TALGATEI (SEQ ID NO: 363) peptide concatemer with IgKappa signal peptide and MHC class I cytoplasmic domain
(7) Heat-inactivated DENV2 (D2Y98P)
(8) No immunization
[1245]
The immunogenicity of the peptide concatemeric candidate vaccines was determined in AG129 mice against challenge with a lethal dose of DENV strain D2Y98P. AG129 mice, which lack IFN α/β and γ receptor signaling, injected intradermally in the footpad with 104 PFU of DENV do not survive past day 5 post-injection. (In this study, the mice died due to a problem with the heat-attenuation). The tested vaccines included constructs (1)-(8) disclosed above. AG129 mice were vaccinated via intramuscular (IM) injection with either 2 μg or 10 μg of the candidate vaccine. The vaccines were given to AG129 mice as a prime and a boost (second dose provided 28 days after the first dose). The positive control group was vaccinated with heat-inactivated DENV2. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a negative control.
[1246]
On day 56, mice were challenged with mouse-adapted DENV2 and monitored for 10 days for weight loss, morbidity, and mortality. Mice that displayed severe illness, defined as >30% weight loss, a health score of 6 or above, extreme lethargy, and/or paralysis were euthanized. Notably, mice “vaccinated” with heat-inactivated DENV (positive control group) became morbid and died (they were not included in the challenge portion of the study).
[1247]
In addition, individual serum samples were collected prior to challenge on day 54 and PBMCs were isolated and frozen for subsequent testing.
[1248]
The AG129 mice PBMCs were thawed and stimulated with TALGATEI (SEQ ID NO: 363) peptide for 5 hours in a standard intracellular cytokine assay. For intracellular cytokine staining, PBMCs were thawed and suspended in media. The TALGATEI (SEQ ID NO: 363) peptide was administered to stimulate the cells. After the addition of Golgi plug, cells were incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 5 hours. Following stimulation, cells were surface stained, fixed, washed and put at 4° C. overnight. Intracellular staining was performed the following day and assayed via ELISPOT assay to quantify secretion of cytokines by T cells (CD8) as described above to determine T cell activation. If the peptide were an appropriate antigen, some cells would be present antigen during infection and would be capable of stimulating T cells. The results are shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B, which demonstrate that each of the peptides (1)-(6) stimulate T cell activation.
Example 36: Surface-Expressed DENV2 prME Antigens
[1249]
The DENV2 prME polypeptide antigen sequences provided in Tables 28 and 29 were tested to confirm that the DENV prME protein antigen is translated, properly folded and expressed on the surface of cells. For the polypeptide sequences, the bolded sequence is Dengue signal sequence, the underlined sequence is DENV2 precursor membrane sequence, and the unmarked sequence is DENV2 envelope sequence. The sequences encoding the polypeptides are codon-optimized. HeLa cells were transfected with DNA encoding the prMEs from nine different DENV2 isolates. After 24 hours, surface expression of the prME was detected using three different antibodies followed by goat-anti-human AF700 secondary antibody and subjecting the cells to FACS analyses. Each of the three antibodies is broadly neutralizing DENV2 prME antibodies that have in vivo efficacy against Dengue virus. D88 binds to DIII of Envelope protein for all 4 DENV serotypes (US20150225474). 2D22 binds to DIII of Envelope protein for DENV 2 serotype. 5J7 binds to 3 domains of Envelope protein for DENV 3 serotype. FIG. 14B shows that the D88 and 2D22 antibodies recognize two of the DENV2 prME antigens. These results show that the two DENV2 prME antigens identified as Thailand/01 68/1979 and Peru/IQT29 13/1996 are expressed at the cell surface in a conformationally correct form and are excellent vaccine candidates (FIG. 14A). FIG. 14B shows a repeat of staining in triplicate and in two different cell lines (HeLa and 293T). These results confirm proper conformation of expressed DENV2 prME antigens (in particular, the prME antigens from Thailand/01 68/1979 and Peru/IQT29 13/1996) and also evidence at least non-inferior and even superior DENV2 antigenicity as compared to Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), a live attenuated tetravalent chimeric vaccine. Antigen expressed from the mRNA encoding DENV 2 prME from Peru/IQT2913/1996 shows the best binding to 2 different DENV2 antibodies in 293T cells and in HeLa cells (D88—binds all 4 serotypes 2D22—binds DENV 2). This construct has a single amino acid difference from the DENV 2 Envelope III Domain immunodeterminant region (see bold, underline in SEQ ID NO: 273, DENV 2 prME (Peru/IQT2913/1996) in Table 29).
Example 37: OVA Multitope In Vitro Screening Assay Kinetic Analysis
[1250]
Antigen surface presentation is an inefficient process in the antigen presenting cells (APC). Peptides generated from proteasome degradation of the antigens are presented with low efficiency (only 1 peptide of 10000 degraded molecules is actually presented). Thus, priming of CD8 T cells with APCs provides insufficient densities of surface peptide/MHC I complexes, resulting in weak responders exhibiting impaired cytokine secretion and decreased memory pool. To improve DENV mRNA vaccines encoding concatemeric DENV antigens, an in vitro assay was designed to test the linkers used to connect peptide repeats, the number of peptide repeats, and sequences known to enhance antigen presentation.
[1251]
mRNA constructs encoding one or more OVA epitopes were configured with different linker sequences, protease cleavage sites, and antigen presentation enhancer sequences. Their respective sequences were as shown in Table 43. To perform the assay, 200 ng of each MC3-formulated mRNA construct was transfected into JAWSII cells in a 24-well plate. Cells were isolated at 6, 24, and 48 hours post transfection and stained with fluorescently-labeled Anti-Mouse OVA257-264 (SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 364)) peptide bound to H-2Kb. Staining was analyzed on a LSRFortessa flow cytometer. Samples were run in triplicate. The Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) for each mRNA construct was measured and shown in FIG. 15. Constructs 2, 3, 7, 9, and 10 showed enhanced surface presentation of the OVA epitope, indicating that the configurations of these constructs may be used for DENV mRNA vaccine. Construct 5 comprises a single OVA peptide and a KDEL sequence that is known to prevent the secretion of a protein. Construct 5 showed little surface antigen presentation because the secretion of the peptide was inhibited.
Example 38: Antibody Binding to DENV-1, 2, 3, and 4 prME Epitopes
[1252]
DENV mRNA vaccines encoding concatemeric antigen epitopes were tested for binding to antibodies known to recognize one or more DENV serotypes. To test antibody binding to the epitopes, 200 ng of DENV mRNA vaccines encoding different Dengue prME epitopes were transfected into HeLa cells in 24-well plates using the TransitIT-mRNA Transfection Kit (Mires Bio). The DENV mRNA vaccine constructs are shown in Table 28. Transfections were done in triplicate. After 24 hours, surface expression was detected using four different antibodies (10 μg/mL) followed by either goat-anti-human or anti-mouse AF700 secondary antibody (1/500). Signal generated from antibody binding are shown as Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) (FIG. 16). Antibody D88 is known to recognize all 4 serotypes and bound to all antigen epitopes encoded by the DENV mRNA vaccine constructs tested. Antibody 2D22 is known to recognize only DENV 2 and preferentially bound to construct 21, which encodes DENV 2 antigen epitopes. Antibody 2D22 also showed weak binding to epitopes of other DENV serotypes. Antibody 5J7 is known to recognize only DENV 3 and only bound to antigen epitopes encoded by constructs 13, 19, and 20, which encode DENV 3 antigen epitopes. Antibody 1-11 is known to bind strongly to DENV 1 and 2, to bind weakly to DENV 3 and to bind little DENV 4. Antibody 1-11 bound to DENV 1, 2, and 3, and binding to DENV 3 antigen epitopes was stronger than binding to DENV 1 or 2 (FIG. 16).
Example 39: DENV prME Challenge Study in Cynomolgus (Cyno) Monkey Model
[1253]
Shown in Table 45 is the design of DENV prME challenge study in cynomolgus (cyno) money. Indicated DENV mRNA vaccine encoding prME antigen epitopes, or vaccines thereof, are used to immunize cyno. The vaccines are formulated in lipid nanoparticles (e.g., MC3 formulation) and administered to the cyno monkeys intramuscularly on day 0, 21, and 42. Dosages of the vaccines are 250 μg or 5 μg per immunization. In experiments where a combination of different DENV mRNA vaccines are used, 250 μg or 5 μg of each mRNA vaccine is used. FLAG-tagged H10N8 flu vaccine is used as control at a dosage of 250 μg per immunization. Naïve cyno monkeys without immunization are also used as control. Cyno monkey sera are collected on days 20, 41, 62, and 92 post initial immunization and used for serotype-specific neutralization assays.
[1254]
Immunized cyno monkeys are challenged on day 63 post initial immunization with indicated DENV viruses. Cyno monkey sera are collected on days 62 (pre-challenge), 63-66, 68, 70, 72, 76, and 92 (end of life) to determine serum viral load.
Example 40: Dengue 2 prME Challenge Study in AG129 Mice
[1255]
The instant study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of four DENV mRNA vaccine constructs (constructs 21-24 in Table 44) in AG129 mice challenge assays. The schedule of the challenge study is shown in FIG. 17A. The DENV mRNA vaccines were formulated in lipid nanoparticles (e.g., MC3 formulation) and administered to the AG129 mice intramuscularly on days 0 and 21. Dosages of the vaccines were 2 μg or 10 μg per immunization. Heat inactivated D2Y98P strain was used as a negative control to vaccinate the mice. Naïve AG129 mice without immunization were also used as control.
[1256]
Immunized AG129 mice were challenged on day 42 post initial immunization with Dengue D2Y98P virus (s.c., 1e5 PFU per mouse). AG129 mice sera were collected on days 20 and 41 post initial immunization and used for serotype-specific neutralization assays. Mice immunized with any of the four DENV mRNA vaccine constructs survived, while the control mice died. These data demonstrate that, after lethal challenge, there was 100% protection provided by each mRNA vaccine construct, regardless of dose. The weights and health of the mice were monitored and the results were plotted in FIGS. 17C-17D.
[1257]
Mice sera collected from mice immunized with 2 μg of the DENV mRNA vaccines were able to neutralize several DENV 2 strains and variations in the neutralization ability between the tested mRNA vaccines and between different DENV 2 strains were observed (FIG. 18).
Example 41: DENV prME Challenge Study in AG129 Mouse Model
[1258]
Shown in Table 46 is the design of a DENV prME challenge study in AG129 mice, including the mRNA constructs tested, the vaccination schedule, the dosage, the challenge strains, and the serum collection schedule.
[1259]
Indicated DENV mRNA vaccines encoding prME antigen epitopes, or vaccines thereof, were used to immunize AG129 mice. The vaccines were formulated in lipid nanoparticles (e.g., MC3 formulation) and administered to the mice intramuscularly on days 0 and 21. Dosages of the vaccines were 2 μg or 10 μg per immunization. In experiments where a combination of different DENV mRNA vaccines was used, 2 μg of each mRNA vaccine was used. Naïve AG129 mice without immunization were used as control. AG129 mice sera were collected on days 20 and 41 post initial immunization and used for serotype-specific neutralization assays.
[1260]
Immunized AG129 mice were challenged on day 42 post initial immunization with Dengue D2Y98P virus (s.c., 1e5 PFU per mouse). The weights and health of the mice were monitored for 14 days post infection and the results were plotted in FIGS. 19A-19I.
Example 42: Virus-Like Particles
[1261]
The antigens produced from the DENV prME mRNA vaccines of the present disclosure, when expressed, are able to assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs). The instant study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the VLPs by negative stain electron microscope imaging. DENV mRNA vaccine constructs 21-24 were expressed and VLPs were assembled an isolated. The VLPs were visualized under negative stain electron microscopy. Construct 23 is the vaccine construct used by Sanofi in its DENV vaccines. Constructs 21, 22, and 24 produced more uniform VLPs, suggesting that these VLPs may be more superior in their immunogenicity than the VLPs produced from construct 23.
Example 43: Exemplary Nucleic Acids Encoding CHIKV RNA Polynucleotides for Use in a RNA Vaccine
[1262]
Exemplary sequences that can be used to encode CHIKV E1, E2, E1-E2, and C-E3-E2-6K-E1 RNA polynucleotides for use in the CHIKV RNA vaccine are given in Table 47.
Example 44: Protocol to Determine Efficacy of mRNA-Encoded Chikungunya Antigen Candidates Against CHIKV
[1263]
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has a polycistronic genome and different antigens, based on the Chikungunya structural protein, are possible. There are membrane-bound and secreted forms of E1 and E2, as well as the full length polyprotein antigen, which retains the protein's native conformation. Additionally, the different CHIKV genotypes can also yield different antigens.
[1264]
The efficacy of CHIKV candidate vaccines in AG129 mice against challenge with a lethal dose of CHIKV strain 181/25 was investigated. A129 mice, which lack IFN α/β receptor signaling, injected intradermally in the footpad with 104 PFU of CHIKV 181/25 virus have a 100% survival rate post-injection. In contrast, AG129 mice, which lack IFN α/β and γ receptor signaling, injected intradermally in the footpad with 104 PFU of CHIKV 181/25 virus do not survive past day 5 post-injection. The tested vaccines included: MC3-LNP formulated mRNA encoded CHIKV-E1, MC3-LNP formulated mRNA encoded CHIKV-E2, and MC3-LNP formulated mRNA encoded CHIKV-E1/E2/E3/C. Fifteen groups of five AG129 mice were vaccinated via intradermal (ID) or intramuscular (IM) injection with either 2 μg or 10 μg of the candidate vaccine. The vaccines were given to AG129 mice as single or two doses (second dose provided 28 days after the first dose). The positive control group was vaccinated via intranasal instillation (20 μL volume) with heat-inactivated CHIKV. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a negative control.
[1265]
On day 56, mice were challenged with 1×104 PFU of CHIKV via ID injection in a 50 μL volume and monitored for 10 days for weight loss, morbidity, and mortality. Mice that displayed severe illness, defined as >30% weight loss, a health score of 6 or above, extreme lethargy, and/or paralysis were euthanized. Notably, mice “vaccinated” with heat-inactivated CHIKV (positive control group) became morbid and were euthanized following the second dose of HI-CHIKV (they were not included in the challenge portion of the study).
[1266]
In addition, individual samples were tested for reactivity in a semi-quantitative ELISA for mouse IgG against either Chikungunya-specific E1 (groups 1-4), Chikungunya-specific E2 (groups 5-8), or Chikungunya-specific E1 and E2 proteins (groups 9-15).
[1267]
The health status is scored as indicated in Table 51.
Example 45: Efficacy of Chikungunya E1 Antigen mRNA Vaccine Candidate
[1268]
AG129 mice (n=5 per group) were vaccinated with 2 μg or 10 μg of MC-3-LNP formulated mRNA encoding CHIKV E1. The AG129 mice were vaccinated on either Day 0 or Days 0 and 28 via IM or ID delivery. On Day 56 following final vaccination all mice were challenged with a lethal dose of CHIKV. The survival curve, percent weight loss, and health status of the mice vaccinated with 2 μg CHIKV E1 mRNA are shown in FIGS. 21A-21C. The survival results are tabulated in Table 52. The survival curve, percent weight loss, and health status of the mice vaccinated with 10 μg CHIKV E1 mRNA are shown in FIGS. 24A-24C. The survival results are tabulated in Table 53.
[1269]
As shown in Table 52, the 2 μg dose of CHIKV E1 mRNA vaccine gave no protection post-CHIKV infection challenge when administered via IM or ID with either a single dose or two doses. Likewise, the single dose of 10 μg CHIKV E1 vaccine provided little to no protection when administered via IM or ID. However, as indicated in Table 53, the 10 μg dose of CHIKV E1 mRNA vaccine provided 60% protection post-CHIKV challenge when administered via IM using two doses and provided 80% protection post-CHIKV challenge when administered via ID using two doses.
[1270]
In all experiments, the negative control mice had a ˜0% survival rate, as did the positive control mice (heat-inactivated CHIKV), which died before CHIKV challenge. Some mice died during the vaccination period.

[1271]
AG129 mice (n=5 per group) were vaccinated with 2 μg or 10 μg of MC-3-LNP formulated mRNA encoding CHIKV E2. The mice were vaccinated on either Day 0 or Days 0 and 28 via IM or ID delivery. On Day 56 following final vaccination all mice were challenged with a lethal dose of CHIKV. The survival curve, percent weight loss, and health status of the mice vaccinated with 2 μg CHIKV E2 mRNA are shown in FIGS. 22A-22C. The survival results are tabulated in Table 54 below. The survival curve, percent weight loss, and health status of the mice vaccinated with 10 μg CHIKV E2 mRNA are shown in FIGS. 25A-25C. The survival results are tabulated in Table 55.
[1272]
As shown in Table 54, the 2 μg dose of CHIKV E2 mRNA vaccine gave no protection post-CHIKV infection challenge when administered via IM or ID in a single dose. However, when provided in two doses, the 2 μg dose of CHIKV E2 mRNA vaccine provided 80% protection when administered via IM and 100% protection when administered via ID post-CHIKV challenge. As indicated in Table 55, the 10 μg dose of CHIKV E2 mRNA mouse provided no protection post-CHIKV challenge when administered via IM or ID in a single dose. However, administration of CHIKV E2 mRNA via IM or ID using two doses provided 100% protection post-CHIKV challenge.
[1273]
In all experiments, the negative control mice had a ˜0% survival rate, as did the positive control mice (heat-inactivated CHIKV) which died prior to CHIKV challenge. Some mice died during the vaccination period.
Example 47: Efficacy of Chikungunya C-E3-E2-6K-E1 Antigen mRNA Vaccine Candidate
[1274]
AG129 mice (n=5 per group) were vaccinated with 2 μg or 10 μg of MC-3-LNP formulated mRNA encoding CHIKV C-E3-E2-6K-E1 mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 388/401). The AG129 mice were vaccinated on either Day 0 or Days 0 and 28 via IM or ID delivery. On Day 56 following final vaccination all mice were challenged with a lethal dose of CHIKV. The survival curve, percent weight loss, and health status of the mice vaccinated with 2 μg CHIKV C-E3-E2-6K-E1 mRNA are shown in FIGS. 23A-23C. The survival results are tabulated in Table 56. The survival curve, percent weight loss, and health status of the mice vaccinated with 10 μg CHIKV C-E3-E2-6K-E1/E2/E3/C mRNA are shown in FIGS. 26A-26C. The survival results are tabulated in Table 57.
[1275]
As shown in Table 56, the 2 μg dose of C-E3-E2-6K-E1 mRNA vaccine provided 100% protection post-CHIKV challenge when administered via IM in a single dose and provided 80% protection post-CHIKV challenge when administered via ID in a single dose. The 2 μg dose of C-E3-E2-6K-E1 mRNA vaccine provided 100% protection post-CHIKV challenge when administered via IM or ID in two doses. As shown in Table 57, the 10 μg dose of C-E3-E2-6K-E1 mRNA vaccine provided 100% protection post-CHIKV infection challenge when administered via IM or ID in either a single dose or in two doses.
[1276]
In all experiments, the negative control mice had a ˜0% survival rate, as did the positive control mice (heat-inactivated CHIKV) which died prior to CHIKV challenge. Some mice died during the vaccination period.

[1277]
Table 58 shows the survival data of the mice vaccinated with the CHIKV mRNA antigens used in the studies reported in Examples 45-47.
Example 49: In Vitro Transfection of mRNA-Encoded Chikungunya Virus Envelope Protein
[1278]
The in vitro transfection of mRNA encoding Notch and a PBS control were performed in 150 k HeLa cells/well transfected with 1 μg mRNA+2 μL LF2000/well in a 24 well plate. Lysate containing proteins expressed from the CHIKV envelope mRNAs transfected in HeLa cells were collected 16 hours post-transfection and then detected by Western blotting with a V5 tag-HRP antibody. The successful detection of a CHIKV envelope protein is shown in FIG. 20.
Example 50: Detection of Immunity (Mouse IgG) Against Either Chikungunya-Specific E1, Chikungunya-Specific E2, or Chikungunya-Specific E1 and E2 Proteins
[1279]
Serum samples from mice vaccinated with the CHIKV E1, E2, or E1-E2-E3-C vaccine described in Examples 45-47 were tested using a semi-quantitative ELISA for the detection of mouse IgG against either Chikungunya-specific E1, Chikungunya-specific E2, or Chikungunya-specific E1 and E2 proteins.
[1280]
Fifteen groups of five mice were vaccinated via intradermal (ID) or intramuscular (IM) injection with either 2 μg or 10 μg of the candidate vaccine. The vaccines were given to AG129 mice as single or two doses (second dose provided 28 days after the first dose). On day 56, mice were challenged with 1×104 PFU of CHIKV via ID injection in 50 μL volume and monitored for 10 days for weight loss, morbidity, and mortality. Mice were bled on day 7 and day 28 post-vaccination via the peri-orbital sinus (retro-orbital bleed). In addition, mice surviving the CHIKV challenge were bled 10 days post-challenge.
[1281]
The individual samples were tested for reactivity in a semi-quantitative ELISA for mouse IgG against either Chikungunya-specific E1, Chikungunya-specific E2, or Chikungunya-specific E1 and E2 proteins. The results are shown in FIGS. 34-36.
[1282]
The data depicting the results of the ELISA assay to identify the amount of antibodies produced in AG129 mice in response to vaccination with mRNA encoding secreted CHIKV E1 structural protein, secreted CHIKV E2 structural protein, or CHIKV full structural polyprotein C-E3-E2-6k-E1 at a dose of 10 μg or 2 μg at 28 days post immunization is shown in FIGS. 34-35. The 10 μg of mRNA encoding CHIKV polyprotein produced significant levels of antibody in both studies. The data depicting a comparison of ELISA titers from the data of FIG. 34 to survival in the data of FIG. 35 left panel is shown in FIG. 36. As shown in the survival results, the animals vaccinated with either dose (single or double administration) of mRNA encoding CHIKV polyprotein had 100% survival rates.
Example 51: Efficacy of Chikungunya Polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) mRNA Vaccine Candidate
[1283]
AG129 mice (n=5 per group) were vaccinated with either 10 μg, 2 μg or 0.4 μg of MC-3-LNP formulated mRNA encoded CHIKV polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) (SEQ ID NO: 388/401). The mice were vaccinated on either Day 0 or Days 0 and 28 via IM delivery. In one study, all mice were challenged on day 56 with a lethal dose of CHIKV following final vaccination. In another study, all mice were challenged on day 84 with a lethal dose of CHIKV following final vaccination. The survival curve, percent weight loss, and health status of the mice vaccinated with 10 μg, 2 μg or 0.4 μg mRNA were determined as described previously in Examples 45-47. The survival rates, neutralizing antibodies and binding antibodies were assessed. Neutralizing antibodies were also identified against three different strains of CHIKV.
[1284]
The survival rates of the mice vaccinated with mRNA encoding CHIKV C-E3-E2-6k-E1 is shown in FIG. 37. The data depicts vaccination at a dose of 10 μg (left panels), 2 μg (middle panels) or 0.4 μg (right panels) at 56 days (top panels) or 112 days (bottom panels) post immunization. These data demonstrate that a single 2 μg dose of the mRNA vaccine afforded 100% protection for at least 112 days (16 weeks). Following the study out further, the data demonstrated that a single 2 μg dose of the mRNA vaccine afforded 100% protection for at least 140 days (20 weeks.)
[1285]
The neutralizing antibody and binding antibody produced in treated mice is shown in FIGS. 38 and 39, respectively. As can be seen in FIGS. 38 and 39, the levels of neutralizing antibody were dependent or dose and regimen with the highest titers evident with 10 μg dosed twice (days 0 and 28). Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50 and PRNT80) were used to quantify the titer of neutralizing antibody for the virus. Antigen-binding Ab was determined by ELISA. The corresponding correlation between binding Ab and neutralizing antibodies is shown in the bottom panels of FIG. 39. Following the study out to 16 weeks showed that the highest E1 titers were achieved when 10 μg mRNA vaccine was dosed twice.
[1286]
The data depicting neutralizing antibodies against three different strains of CHIKV is shown in FIG. 40. The neutralizing antibodies were tested against three different strains of CHIKV, African-Senegal (left panel), La Reunion (middle panel) and CDC CAR (right panel). FIG. 40 shows that the polyprotein-encoding mRNA vaccine elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies against the three strains tested. Sera were further tested against Chik S27 strain (Chikungunya virus (strain S27-African prototype). The data depicting neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV S27 strain is shown in FIG. 41. These data collectively show that the polyprotein encoding mRNA vaccine elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies against all four strains tested. The vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies against multiple strains of Chikungunya. The prime and boost with the 10 μg dose produced the most robust neutralizing antibody response followed by the single dose with 10 μg.
Example 52: Transfection of mRNA Encoded CHIKV Structural Proteins
[1287]
In vitro transfection of mRNA encoding CHIKV structural proteins and PBS control were performed in 400 k HeLa cells transfected with 1.25 ug mRNA lipoplexed with 5 ul LF2000/well in 6 well plate. Protein detection in HeLa cell lysate 16h post transfection was measured. Lysates which contain proteins expressed from the CHIKV mRNAs transfected in HeLa were collected 16h post transfection. Proteins were detected by WB with anti-Flag or and V5 antibody.
[1288]
The mRNA encoded CHIKV structural proteins and protein production in the HeLa cell lysate 16h post transfection was detected.
Example 53: Exemplary CHIKV Polypeptides
[1289]
The amino acids presented in the Table 48 are exemplary CHIKV antigenic polypeptides. To the extent that any exemplary antigenic peptide described herein includes a flag tag or V5, or a polynucleotide encodes a flag tag or V5, the skilled artisan understands that such flag tag or V5 is excluded from the antigenic polynucleotide in a vaccine formulation. Thus, any of the polynucleotides encoding proteins described herein are encompassed within the compositions of the invention without the flag tag or V5 sequence.
Example 54: Efficacy of CHIKV mRNA Vaccine X Against CHIKV in AG129 Mice Study Design
[1290]
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) 181/25 strain is an attenuated vaccine strain that was developed by the US Army via multiple plaque-to-plaque passages of the 15561 Southeast Asian human isolate (Levitt et al.). It is well tolerated in humans and is highly immunogenic. It produces small plaques and has decreased virulence in infant mice and nonhuman primates. When the attenuated virus is administered to immunodeficient AG129 mice (lacking the IFN-α/β and γ receptors) the mice succumb to a lethal disease within 3-4 days with ruffled fur and weight loss (Partidos, et al. 2011 Vaccine).
[1291]
This instant study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CHIKV candidate vaccines as described herein in AG129 mice (Table 59). The study included 14 groups of female 6-8 week old AG129 mice (Table 59). Groups 1-4, 7-8, and 10-15 were vaccinated with CHIKV vaccine X via the intramuscular (IM; 0.05 mL) route on Day 0 and select groups received an additional boost on Day 28. Control Groups 9 and 16 received vehicle (PBS) only on Days 0 and 28 via IM route (0.05 mL). Regardless of vaccination schedule, Groups 1-4 and 7-9 were challenged on Day 56 while Groups 10-16 were challenged on Day 112 using the CHIKV 181/25 strain (stock titer 3.97×107 PFU/mL, challenge dose 1×104 PFU/mouse). For virus challenge, all mice received a lethal dose (1×104 PFU) of Chikungunya (CHIK) strain 181/25 via intradermal (ID) route (0.050 mL via footpad). All mice were monitored for 10 days post infection for weight loss, morbidity, and mortality. Each mice was assigned a heath score based on Table 51. Mice displaying severe illness as determined by >30% weight loss, a health score of higher than 5, extreme lethargy, and/or paralysis were euthanized with a study endpoint of day 10 post virus challenge. Test bleeds via retro-orbital (RO) collection were performed on mice from all groups on Days −3, 28, and 56. Mice from Groups 10-16 were also bled on Days 84 & 112. Mice that survived challenge were also terminally bled on Day 10 post challenge. Serum samples from mice (Days −3, 28, 56, 84, 112 and surviving mice) were kept frozen (−80° C.) and stored until they were tested for reactivity in a semi quantitative ELISA for mouse IgG against either E1, E2 or CHIKV lysate.
Experimental Procedure
Intramuscular (IM) Injection of Mice
[1292]
1. Restrain the animal either manually, chemically, or with a restraint device.
[1293]
2. Insert the needle into the muscle. Pull back slightly on the plunger of the syringe to check proper needle placement. If blood is aspirated, redirect the needle and recheck placement again.
[1294]
3. Inject appropriate dose and withdraw needle. Do not exceed maximum volume. If the required volume exceeds the maximum volume allowed, multiple sites may be used with each receiving no more than the maximum volume.
[1295]
4. The injection site may be massaged gently to disperse the injected material.
Intradermal (ID) Injections of Mice
[1296]
1. Restrain the animal either manually, chemically, or with a restraint device.
[1297]
2. Carefully clip the hair from the intended injection site. This procedure can be done upon animals arriving or the day before any procedures or treatments are required.
[1298]
3. Lumbar area is the most common site for ID injections in all species, but other areas can be used as well.
[1299]
4. Pinch or stretch the skin between your fingers (or tweezers) to isolate the injection site.
[1300]
5. With the beveled edge facing up, insert the needle just under the surface between the layers of skin. Inject the appropriate dose and withdraw needle. A small bleb will form when an ID injection is given properly.
[1301]
6. If the required volume exceeds the maximum volume allowed, multiple sites may be used with each receiving no more than the maximum volume.
Retro-Orbital Bleeding in Mice
[1302]
1. Place the mice in the anesthesia chamber and open oxygen line and set to 2.5% purge. Start flow of anesthesia at 5% isoflurane.
[1303]
2. Once the animal becomes sedate, turn anesthesia to 2.5%-3% isoflurane and continue to expose the animal to the anesthesia. Monitor the animal to avoid breathing becoming slow.
[1304]
3. Remove the small rodent from anesthesia chamber and place on its back while restraining with left hand and scruff the back of the animal's neck, so it is easy to restrain and manipulate while performing the procedure with the right hand.
[1305]
4. With a small motion movement, place the capillary tube in the corner of the animal's eye close to the nostril, and rotate or spin the Hematocrit glass pipette until blood start flowing out. Collect the appropriate amount of blood needed into the appropriate labeled vial.
[1306]
5. Monitor the animal after retro-orbital bleeding is done for at least 10-15 seconds to ensure hemostasis.
[1307]
6. Place the animal back to its original cage and monitor for any other problems or issues caused while manipulating animal due to the procedure.
Observation of Mice
[1308]
1. Mice were observed through 10 days post infection (11 days total, 0-10 days post infection).
[1309]
2. Mice were weighed daily on an Ohause scale and the weights are recorded. 3. Survival and health of each mouse were evaluated once time a day using a scoring system of 1-7 described in Table 51.
Infection
[1310]
On either Day 56 (Groups 1-4, 7-9) or Day 112 (Groups 10-16) groups of 5 female 6-8 week old AG129 mice were infected via intradermal injection with 1×104 PFU/mouse of the 181/25 strain of Chikungunya diluted in PBS. The total inoculation volume was 0.05 mL administered in the rear footpad of each animal. Mice were anesthetized lightly using 2-5% v/v of isoflurane at ˜2.5 L/min of 02 (VetEquip IMPAC6) immediately prior to infection.
Dose Administration
[1311]
In this study mice were administered 0.04 μg, 2 μg, or 10 μg of various formulations of the CHIKV vaccine X or vehicle alone (PBS) on either Day 0 or on Days 0 and 28 via the intramuscular route (0.05 mL). The material was pre-formulated and diluted in PBS by IBT prior to dosing.
Results
[1312]
Mice were immunized once (Day 0) or twice (Days 0 & 28) with either 0.04 μg, 2 μg, or 10 μg of Chikungunya mRNA vaccine X and were challenged with CHIKV strain 181/25 on either Day 56 (Groups 1-4, 7-9) or on Day 112 (Groups 10-16). Mice were monitored for a total of 10 days post infection for health and weight changes. Mice that received either 2 μg or 10 μg of the CHIKV mRNA vaccine X either once (Day 0) or twice (Days 0 and 28) were fully protected (100%) regardless of whether the mice were challenged 56 days or 112 days after the initial vaccination (FIGS. 27A-27B, Table 44). Mice receiving 0.04 μg of the CHIKV mRNA vaccine were not protected at all from lethal CHIKV infection. This efficacy data is supported by the health scores observed in the vaccinated mice in that the protected mice displayed little to no adverse health effects of a CHIKV infection (FIGS. 29A-29B). Weight loss is not a strong indicator of disease progression in the CHIKV AG129 mouse model (FIGS. 28A-28B).
[1313]
Mice immunized with the CHIKV mRNA vaccine X showed increased antibody titers against CHIKV E1, E2 and CHIKV lysate as compared to the vehicle only (PBS) treated groups. Serum binding against the virus lysate yielded the highest antibody titers for all vaccinated groups (FIGS. 30A-30C, 31A-31C, 32A-32C, 33A-33C). Overall, the antibody titers were dose dependent with the highest titers observed in serum from mice vaccinated with 10 μg of CHIKV mRNA vaccine X while the lowest titers were observed in serum from mice vaccinated with 0.04 μg of the CHIKV mRNA vaccine X. Similarly, higher titers were observed in serum from mice vaccinated twice (Days 0 and 28) as compared to serum from mice vaccinated only once (Day 0). Serum obtained on Day 112 post initial vaccination still yielded increased antibody titers in mice that received either 10 μg or 2 μg of CHIKV mRNA vaccine X (FIGS. 32A-32C).
[1314]
Serum from mice groups 10-16, 112 days post immunization were also tested in a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). Serum from each mice was diluted from 1/20 to 1/40960 and assessed for its ability to reduce CHIKV plaque formation. The results were shown in Table 64.
Example 55: Immunogenicity of Chikungunya Polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) mRNA Vaccine Candidate in Rats
[1315]
Sprague Dawley rats (n=5) were vaccinated with 20 μg of MC-3-LNP formulated mRNA 30 encoded CHIKV polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) (SEQ ID NO: 388/401). The rats were vaccinated on either Day 0 or Days 0 and 14 or Days 0, 14 and 28 via IM delivery. Sera were collected on days −3, 14, 28 and 42 for ELISA testing. FIG. 42 demonstrated that there was at least a two log increase in antibody titer against CHIKV lysate post 3rd vaccination with the mRNA vaccine in normal rats.
Example 56: Evaluation of T Cell Activation of Chikungunya P 5 Polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) mRNA Vaccine Candidate
[1316]
C57BL/6 mice (n=6 experimental group; n=3 control group) were vaccinated with 10 μg of MC-3-LNP formulated mRNA encoded CHIKV polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) (SEQ ID NO: 388/401). The mice were vaccinated on either Day 0 or Days 0 and 28 (boost) via IM delivery. Sera was collected on days 3, 28 and 42 for ELISA testing. Animals were sacrificed on day 42 and spleens were harvested for immunological evaluation of T cells. Splenic cells were isolated and analyzed by FACS. Briefly, spleens were removed, cells isolated, and stimulated in vitro with immunogenic peptides found within either C, E1, or E2 region of CHIKV that are known to be CD8 epitopes in B6 mice. The readout for this assay was cytokine secretion (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha), which reveals whether the vaccine induced antigen-specific T cell responses. No CD8 T cell responses were detected using the E2 or C peptide (baseline levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha), whereas there was a response to the E1-corresponding peptide (average of about 0.4% IFN-gamma and 0.1% TNF). The peptides were used to stimulate T cells used in the study were E1=HSMTNAVTI (SEQ ID NO: 414), E2=IILYYYELY (SEQ ID NO: 415), and C=ACLVGDKVM (SEQ ID NO: 416).
[1317]
FIG. 43 shows that the polyprotein-encoding CHIKV polyprotein vaccine elicited high antibody titers against the CHIKV glycoproteins. FIGS. 44 and 45A-45B show T cell activation by E1 peptide.
Example 57: Proof-of-Concept of Immunogenicity in Non-Human Primates
[1318]
The mRNA vaccine was tested in Cynomolgus monkey subjects (n=3 per experimental group, n=3 negative control). Subjects were given an intramuscular (IM) immunization of 25 μg or 75 μg of the vaccine on day 0 (prime), day 28 (boost), and day 56 (boost). The negative control group was administered 75 μg of non-translated irrelevant mRNA (NTIX). The readout for this experiment was serum antibody titers (binding and neutralizing) and a CHIKV-specific T cell response.
[1319]
As shown in FIG. 46, the vaccine induced a robust antibody response. A response was detected after the priming dose, and then increased with the boost, and increased slightly more following the third immunization. Both the 25 μg and 75 μg vaccine groups were immunogenic, and there was a small dose response. Neutralizing titers were a few fold lower than those seen in mice, but were still robust.
[1320]
FIG. 47 shows a robust CD4 response in response to the vaccine. Day 35 T cells, measured one week after the second immunization, were assayed. The peptide pool consisted of 15mers overlapping by 11. The response was measured through peptide stimulation, followed by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. A CHIKV-specific CD4 T cell response was detected, mainly in IL-2 and TNFα. There was a minimal CD8 response as well.
