Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]
The present invention provides cationic lipids and lipid nanoparticle formulations comprising these lipids, alone or in combination with other lipids. These lipid nanoparticles may be formulated with nucleic acids to facilitate their intracellular delivery both in vitro and for in vivo therapeutic applications. The present invention also provides methods of chemical synthesis of these lipids, lipid nanoparticle preparation and formulation with nucleic acids.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]
Therapeutic nucleic acids including small interfering RNA (siRNA), micro RNA (miRNA), antisense oligo nucleotides, messenger RNA (mRNA), ribozymes, pDNA and immune stimulating nucleic acids are act via a variety of mechanisms. Specific proteins can be downregulated by siRNA or miRNA through RNA interference (RNAi). Hematopoietic cells, such as leukocytes in general, and primary T lymphocytes and B-cells in particular, are notoriously hard to transfect with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Modulating immune cells function, such as T cells and B-cells, by downregulating specific genes using RNA interference (RNAi) holds tremendous potential in advancing targeted therapies in many immune related disorders including cancer, inflammation, autoimmunity and viral infections. The therapeutic applications of RNAi are extremely broad, since siRNA and miRNA constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target protein. To date, siRNA constructs have shown the ability to specially silence target proteins in both in vitro and in vivo models. These are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.
[0003]
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the family of large RNA molecules which transport the genetic information from DNA to ribosome. Some nucleic acids, such as mRNA or plasmids, can be used to effect expression of specific cellular products. Such nucleic acids would be useful in the treatment of diseases related deficiency of a protein or enzyme. However many problems associated with nucleic acids in therapeutic contexts. One of the major problems with therapeutic nucleic acids is the stability of the phosphodiester inter nucleotide link and its susceptibility to nucleases. Apart from that these nucleic acids have limited ability to cross the cell membrane.
[0004]
Cationic lipids have proved to be excellent carriers of nucleic acids to treat varies diseases in gene therapy applications. Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids and other co-lipids such as cholesterol, DSPC and PEGylated lipids encapsulated oligonucleotides which protect them from degradation and facilitate the cellular uptake. Nevertheless, there remains a need in the art for suitable and efficient delivery platforms for delivery of oligonucleotides.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005]
The present invention relates to novel cationic lipids which can be used in lipid nanoparticle preparation. These lipid nanoparticles protect nucleic acids from degradation, clearance from circulation and intracellular release. In addition, the nucleic acid encapsulated lipid nanoparticles advantageously are well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with unacceptable toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The present invention also provides the methods of chemical synthesis of these lipids, lipid nanoparticle preparation and formulations with nucleic acids.
[0006]
In some embodiments, the present invention relates to novel cationic lipids, and formulations of such lipids with siRNA and pDNA. These lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were further characterized by DLS and assessed for their in vitro activity in various cancer cell lines.
[0007]
According to the principles of the present invention, the lipids structures are based on functional groups such as hydrazine, hydrazide or hydroxylamine linked, directly or through a linker to a fatty acid residue R—C(═O)—, R—C(═O)—O— or R— wherein RCOOH is the corresponding fatty acid which may be saturated or unsaturated. The lipids also contain a functional head group, for example an amine, an N-containing heterocycle or heteroaryl, or an amino acid side chain (e.g., histidine or arginine side chains), which is linked through a linker, e.g., an alkylene chain. In some embodiments, the lipids feature an asymmetrical structure and enhanced charge, hence it is hypothesized that such lipids will display improved binding and improve endosomal escape (i.e., enhanced stability) due to structural imbalance. Other lipids according to the invention have symmetrical structures as further described herein.

[0304]
LNPs were prepared by using microfluidic micro mixture (Precision NanoSystems, Vancouver, BC, Canada) as described by Cohen et. al. One volume of lipid mixtures (cationic lipid, DSPC, Chol, DMG-PEG and DSPE-PEG Mal at 50:10:38:1.5:0.5 mole ratio, 9.64 nM total lipid concentration) in ethanol and three volumes of siRNA (1:16 w/w siRNA to lipid) containing acetate buffer solutions were injected through the micro mixer at a combined flow rate of 2 mL/minute (0.5 mL/min for ethanol and 1.5 mL/min for aqueous buffer).

Size, ζ-Potential and Ultrastructure Analysis of a CD38-LNPs-siRNA
[0305]
LNPs size distribution and ζ potential were determined by dynamic light scattering using a Malvern nano ZS ζ-sizer (Malvern instruments, UK). For size measurements, LNPs were diluted 1:20 in PBS. All utilized samples showed a polydispersity index (PDI) lower than 0.2. For ζ potential measurements, LNPs were diluted 1:200 in DDW. In some cases, as indicated, size and zeta potential measurements were performed in water.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
[0306]
The mRNA levels of pololike kinase 1 (PLK1 gene) in cells was quantified by real-time PCR, forty eight or Seventy-two hours post-transfection. Total RNA was isolated using the E-Z RNA purification kit (Biological industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), and 1 μg of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), Quantification of cDNA (5 ng total) was performed on the step one Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) using syber green (Applied Biosystems). GAPDH was chosen as a housekeeping gene.

LNPs containing different siRNAs (siPLK1 or siCD45 or siLUC) were added to the wells and the concentration was mentioned in figures. Cells were isolated at different time intervals mentioned in the figures and analyzed by either flow cytometry (for siCD45 knockdown), or qPCR for analysis of PLK1 silencing. Apoptosis assay using PI/Annexin was analyzed by flow cytometry in case of siPLK1 induced cell death.
Cell Cycle Studies:
[0308]
The transfected cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol for 1 h. Then, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated for 10 min at 37° C. in 250 μL PBS with 10 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI), 2.5 μg/mL DNase-free RNase A (Sigma, USA) and 0.01% Triton-X. PI fluorescence was assessed by flow cytometry. Analyzes by FlowJo™ were performed on at least 9000 cells per samples after gating out debris and cell duplets based on the FL2-Area/FL2-Width channels. Cell cycle distributions were obtained via the application of the Dean-Jett-Fox model on gated cells with RMS scores ranging between 1.5 and 2.5.
