BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]
The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major health problem worldwide and more than 350 million people are chronic carriers. HBV infection is a serious and common infectious disease of the liver. Chronic infection is associated with an increased risk to develop severe liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common forms of human cancer. The estimated risk of HCC in chronic HBV carriers is approximately 100 times greater than in uninfected individuals. About a third of the world population has been infected at one point in their lives, including 240 million to 350 million who have chronic infections. Over 750,000 people die of hepatitis B each year. About 300,000 of these are due to liver cancer. Currently available anti-HBV drugs have limitations. For example, interferon alpha administration is associated with severe adverse reactions. Nucleoside analogues are virostatic and require long-term administration.
[0004]
The HBV genome exhibits genetic variability with an estimated rate of 1.4-3.2×10−5 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. A large number of virus variants arise during replication as a result of nucleotide misincorporations in the absence of any proof reading capacity by the viral polymerase. This variability has resulted in well-recognized subtypes of the virus. HBV has been classified into well-defined genotypes on the basis of an inter-group divergence of 8% or more in the complete genomic sequence, each having a distinct geographical distribution. For example, Genotype A is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Europe, and Western Africa; genotypes B and C are common in Asia; genotype C is primarily observed in Southeast Asia; genotype D is dominant in Africa, Europe, Mediterranean countries, and India; genotype G is reported in France, Germany, and the United States; and genotype H is commonly encountered in Central and South America. Genotype I has recently been reported in Vietnam and Laos. The newest HBV genotype, genotype J, has been identified in the Ryukyu Islands in Japan.
[0005]
HBV is an enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family. It contains a small, partially double-stranded (DS), relaxed-circular DNA (rcDNA) genome that replicates by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). The circular DNA genome of HBV is unusual because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand is linked to the viral DNA polymerase. The genome is approximately 3020-3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700-2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA.
[0006]
There are four known genes encoded by the genome, referred to as C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. The HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. The DNA polymerase is encoded by gene P. Gene S codes for the surface antigen (HBsAg). The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame “start” (ATG) codons that divide the gene into three sections: pre-S1, pre-S2, and S. Because of the multiple start codons, polypeptides of three different sizes called Large (the order from surface to the inside: pre-S 1/pre-S2/S), Middle (pre-S2/S), and Small (S) are produced. The function of the protein coded for by gene X is not fully understood but it is associated with the development of liver cancer. It stimulates genes that promote cell growth and inactivates growth regulating molecules.
[0007]
The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined.
[0008]
The HBV life cycle begins when the virus attaches to the host cell and is internalized. Recent studies have demonstrated that sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a functional receptor in HBV infection. The virion relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) is delivered to the nucleus, where it is repaired to form a covalently closed-circular DNA (cccDNA). The episomal cccDNA serves as the template for the transcription of the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and the other viral mRNAs by the host RNA polymerase II. The transcripts are then exported to the cytoplasm, where translation of the viral proteins occurs. Reverse transcriptase (RT) binds to pgRNA and triggers assembly of the core proteins into immature, RNA-containing nucleocapsids. The immature nucleocapsids then undergo a process of maturation whereby pgRNA is reversed transcribed by RT to make the mature rcDNA. A unique feature of hepadnavirus reverse transcription is the RT primed initiation of minus-strand DNA synthesis, which leads to the covalent linkage of RT to the 5′ end of the minus-strand DNA.
[0009]
The mature, rcDNA-containing nucleocapsids are then enveloped by the viral surface proteins and secreted as virions (secretion pathway) or, alternatively, are recycled back to the nucleus to further amplify the pool of cccDNA (recycling pathway). Persistence of cccDNA in hepatocytes plays a key role in viral persistence, reactivation of viral replication after cessation of antiviral therapy, and resistance to therapy.
[0010]
Homing endonucleases are a group of naturally-occurring nucleases which recognize 15-40 base-pair cleavage sites commonly found in the genomes of plants and fungi. They are frequently associated with parasitic DNA elements, such as group 1 self-splicing introns and inteins. They naturally promote homologous recombination or gene insertion at specific locations in the host genome by producing a double-stranded break in the chromosome, which recruits the cellular DNA-repair machinery (Stoddard (2006), Q. Rev. Biophys. 38: 49-95). Homing endonucleases are commonly grouped into four families: the LAGLIDADG (SEQ ID NO: 2) family, the GIY-YIG family, the His-Cys box family and the HNH family. These families are characterized by structural motifs, which affect catalytic activity and recognition sequence. For instance, members of the LAGLIDADG (SEQ ID NO: 2) family are characterized by having either one or two copies of the conserved LAGLIDADG (SEQ ID NO: 2) motif (see Chevalier et al. (2001), Nucleic Acids Res. 29(18): 3757-3774). The LAGLIDADG (SEQ ID NO: 2) homing endonucleases with a single copy of the LAGLIDADG (SEQ ID NO: 2) motif form homodimers, whereas members with two copies of the LAGLIDADG (SEQ ID NO: 2) motif are found as monomers. Methods for producing homing endonucleases are known in the art.
[0011]
I-CreI (SEQ ID NO: 1) is a member of the LAGLIDADG (SEQ ID NO: 2) family of homing endonucleases which recognizes and cuts a 22 basepair recognition sequence in the chloroplast chromosome of the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Genetic selection techniques have been used to modify the wild-type I-CreI cleavage site preference (Sussman et al. (2004), J. Mol. Biol. 342: 31-41; Chames et al. (2005), Nucleic Acids Res. 33: e178; Seligman et al. (2002), Nucleic Acids Res. 30: 3870-9, Arnould et al. (2006), J. Mol. Biol. 355: 443-58). Methods for rationally-designing mono-LAGLIDADG (SEQ ID NO: 2) homing endonucleases were described which are capable of comprehensively redesigning I-CreI and other homing endonucleases to target widely-divergent DNA sites, including sites in mammalian, yeast, plant, bacterial, and viral genomes (see, e.g., WO 2007/047859).
[0012]
As first described in WO 2009/059195, I-CreI and its engineered derivatives are normally dimeric but can be fused into a single polypeptide using a short peptide linker that joins the C-terminus of a first subunit to the N-terminus of a second subunit (see also Li et al. (2009), Nucleic Acids Res. 37:1650-62; Grizot et al. (2009), Nucleic Acids Res. 37:5405-19). Thus, a functional “single-chain” meganuclease can be expressed from a single transcript.
[0013]
The use of engineered meganucleases for treatment of HBV infections has been suggested. For example, WO 2010/136841 suggests the use of engineered meganucleases for cleaving the genome of non-genomically integrating viruses. Such meganucleases include variants of I-CreI targeting 22 base pair meganuclease recognition sequences which differ from those disclosed herein, and which are only present in a few HBV genotypes.
[0014]
Applicants previously disclosed in PCT/US2017/56638 a number of first-generation engineered meganucleases having specificity for recognition sequences present in the HBV genome, including the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence (SEQ ID NO: 10) which is advantageously present in the genome of at least HBV genotypes A-G (SEQ ID NOs: 3-9).
[0015]
The present invention improves upon the engineered meganucleases previously described in the art in a number of aspects. When generating an endonuclease for therapeutic administration to a patient, it is critical that on-target specificity is enhanced (i.e., increased) while reducing or eliminating off-target cutting within the target cell genome. Here, Applicants have developed second-generation engineered meganucleases which target the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence. The meganucleases of the present invention have novel and unique sequences which were generated through extensive experimentation. Additionally, these second-generation meganucleases have a number of improved and unexpected properties when compared to the previously disclosed first-generation nucleases, including a significant reduction in off-target cutting in the host cell genome and enhanced (i.e., increased) formation of indels (i.e., insertions or deletions within the HBV genome at the cleavage site, indicative of on-target cutting) in cell lines comprising an integrated copy of the HBV genome. Thus, the meganucleases of the invention advance the art in a number of ways that are necessary for development of a clinical product targeting HBV infection and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0016]
The present invention provides second-generation engineered meganucleases that recognize and cleave a recognition sequence conserved across multiple genotypes of Hepatitis B viruses. Cleavage at the recognition sequence by an engineered meganuclease disclosed herein can disrupt expression of one or more viral proteins due to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at the cleavage site. NHEJ can result in insertions, deletions, or result in a frameshift mutation that can interfere with gene expression. Alternatively, a “suicide gene” can be introduced into a Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome via homologous recombination. In another embodiment, the HBV genome or cccDNA may be degraded following cleavage at the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence. Accordingly, by interrupting normal gene expression, the infection and proliferation of HBV can be reduced or eliminated according to the methods disclosed herein. Such meganucleases are, therefore, useful for treating or reducing the proliferation of HBV in infected individuals worldwide.
[0017]
Suppression or eradication of the replication of HBV in the liver leads to improved liver pathology and decreased progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treatment of a subject having HBV or HCC which utilize an engineered meganuclease having specificity for a recognition sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 10 within a Hepatitis B virus genome. The present invention further provides methods of delivering the engineered meganucleases disclosed herein, or a nucleic acid encoding the same, to a subject infected with HBV in order to reduce the level of HBV virus or HBV cccDNA and/or reduce the symptoms associated with an HBV infection.
[0018]
In some embodiments, the presently disclosed engineered meganucleases exhibit at least one optimized characteristic in comparison to the first-generation meganuclease HBV 11-12x.26. Such optimized characteristics include improved (i.e., increased) specificity resulting in reduced off-target cutting, and enhanced (i.e., increased) efficiency of cleavage and indel formation at the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, for example in cells comprising an integrated copy of the HBV genome.
[0019]

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES
[0085]
FIG. 1 shows a genomic map of the HBV genome and identifies all ORFs. Virus particles have a partially double-stranded genome (indicated by a dashed line) with a cohesive overlap that spans the 5′ regions of each strand and that is flanked by direct repeat sequences (DR1 and DR2). The gene S encodes the major hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) protein and its glycosylated partner, which are transmembrane proteins in the virus envelope. In-frame sequences upstream from the S gene encode the pre-S domains, which are translated with the S sequences to make the pre-S and S polypeptides (middle and large proteins) that contain the virus receptor for infection of hepatocytes. Gene C encodes the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) which forms the nucleocapsid of the virus. The P region encodes the virus reverse transcriptase that also has DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and RNase H activity required for virus replication. Although HBV is a DNA virus, it replicates through a pre-genomic RNA intermediate. Finally, the X gene encodes the small regulatory protein of the virus, the hepatitis B x (HBx) antigen. HBx is a transactivating protein that stimulates virus gene expression and replication, protects virus-infected cells against immune-mediated destruction and contributes to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
[0086]
FIG. 2. HBV 11-12 recognition sequence in the HBV genome. The HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, targeted by engineered meganucleases of the invention, comprises two recognition half-sites. Each recognition half-site comprises 9 base pairs, separated by a 4 base pair central sequence. The HBV 11-12 recognition sequence (SEQ ID NO: 10) comprises two recognition half-sites referred to as HBV11 and HBV12.
[0087]
FIG. 3. Alignment of HBV recognition sequences in HBV genotypes A-G. The HBV 11-12 recognition sequence targeted by engineered meganucleases of the invention is conserved across multiple HBV genotypes. The HBV 11-12 recognition sequence spans residues 1259-1280 of HBV genotype A set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3, and this recognition sequence is fully conserved in genotypes B, C, D, E, F, and G (SEQ ID NOs: 4-9).
[0088]
FIG. 4. The engineered meganucleases of the invention comprise two subunits, wherein the first subunit comprising the HVR1 region binds to a first recognition half-site (e.g., HBV11) and the second subunit comprising the HVR2 region binds to a second recognition half-site (e.g., HBV12). In embodiments where the engineered meganuclease is a single-chain meganuclease, the first subunit comprising the HVR1 region can be positioned as either the N-terminal or C-terminal subunit. Likewise, the second subunit comprising the HVR2 region can be positioned as either the N-terminal or C-terminal subunit.
[0089]
FIG. 5. Schematic of reporter assay in CHO cells for evaluating engineered meganucleases of the invention. A CHO cell line was produced in which a reporter cassette was integrated stably into the genome of the cell. The reporter cassette comprised, in 5′ to 3′ order: an SV40 Early Promoter; the 5′ 2/3 of the GFP gene; the recognition sequence for an engineered meganuclease of the invention (e.g., the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence); the recognition sequence for the CHO 23/24 meganuclease (WO 2012/167192); and the 3′ 2/3 of the GFP gene. Cells stably transfected with this cassette did not express GFP in the absence of a DNA break-inducing agent. Meganucleases were introduced by transduction of plasmid DNA or mRNA encoding each meganuclease. When a DNA break was induced at either of the meganuclease recognition sequences, the duplicated regions of the GFP gene recombined with one another to produce a functional GFP gene. The percentage of GFP-expressing cells could then be determined by flow cytometry as an indirect measure of the frequency of genome cleavage by the meganucleases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
1.1 References and Definitions
[0135]
The patent and scientific literature referred to herein establishes knowledge that is available to those of skill in the art. The issued US and non-US patents, allowed applications, published US, non-US, and PCT application, co-owned and co-pending unpublished US patent applications, published foreign applications, and scientific, technical, and medical references, including GenBank database sequences, public genetic and protein database accession numbers or codes (and the nucleic acid and/or amino acid sequences associated therewith), which are cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.
[0136]
The present invention can be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. For example, features illustrated with respect to one embodiment can be incorporated into other embodiments, and features illustrated with respect to a particular embodiment can be deleted from that embodiment. In addition, numerous variations and additions to the embodiments suggested herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the instant disclosure, which do not depart from the instant invention.
[0137]
Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood as of the priority date by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.
[0138]
All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
[0139]
As used herein, “a,” “an,” or “the” can mean one or more than one. For example, “a” cell can mean a single cell or a multiplicity of cells.
[0140]
As used herein, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the word “or” is used in the inclusive sense of “and/or” and not the exclusive sense of “either/or.”
[0141]
As used herein, the terms “nuclease” and “endonuclease” refers to enzymes which cleave a phosphodiester bond within a polynucleotide chain.
[0142]
As used herein with respect to double-stranded DNA, the terms “cleave” or “cleavage” refer to the endonuclease-mediated hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds within the backbone of a recognition sequence within a target sequence that results in a double-stranded break within the target sequence, referred to herein as a “cleavage site”. Depending upon the endonuclease, cleavage can result in double-stranded fragments with blunt ends or fragments with 5′ or 3′ base overhangs.
[0143]
As used herein, the term “meganuclease” refers to an endonuclease that binds double-stranded DNA at a recognition sequence that is greater than 12 base pairs. In some embodiments, the recognition sequence for a meganuclease of the present disclosure is 22 base pairs. A meganuclease can be an endonuclease that is derived from I-CreI, and can refer to an engineered variant of I-CreI that has been modified relative to natural I-CreI with respect to, for example, DNA-binding specificity, DNA cleavage activity, DNA-binding affinity, or dimerization properties. Methods for producing such modified variants of I-CreI are known in the art (e.g. WO 2007/047859, incorporated by reference in its entirety). A meganuclease as used herein binds to double-stranded DNA as a heterodimer. A meganuclease may also be a “single-chain meganuclease” in which a pair of DNA-binding domains is joined into a single polypeptide using a peptide linker. The term “homing endonuclease” is synonymous with the term “meganuclease.” Meganucleases of the present disclosure are substantially non-toxic when expressed in the targeted cells as described herein such that cells can be transfected and maintained at 37° C. without observing substantial deleterious effects on overall cell viability or significant reductions in meganuclease cleavage activity when measured using the methods described herein.
[0144]
As used herein, the term “single-chain meganuclease” refers to a polypeptide comprising a pair of nuclease subunits joined by a linker such that the subunits interact functionally like a heterodimer to cleave a double-stranded recognition site. A single-chain meganuclease has the organization: N-terminal subunit-Linker-C-terminal subunit. The two meganuclease subunits will generally be non-identical in amino acid sequence and will recognize non-identical DNA half-sites within a recognition sequence. Thus, single-chain meganucleases typically cleave pseudo-palindromic or non-palindromic recognition sequences. A single-chain meganuclease may be referred to as a “single-chain heterodimer” or “single-chain heterodimeric meganuclease” although it is not, in fact, dimeric. For clarity, unless otherwise specified, the term “meganuclease” can refer to a dimeric or single-chain meganuclease.
[0145]
As used herein, the term “linker” refers to an exogenous peptide sequence used to join two meganuclease subunits into a single polypeptide. A linker may have a sequence that is found in natural proteins, or may be an artificial sequence that is not found in any natural protein. A linker may be flexible and lacking in secondary structure or may have a propensity to form a specific three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. A linker can include, without limitation, any of those encompassed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,445,251, 9,340,777, 9,434,931, and 10,041,053, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

[0146]
As used herein, with respect to a protein, the term “recombinant” or “engineered” means having an altered amino acid sequence as a result of the application of genetic engineering techniques to nucleic acids which encode the protein, and cells or organisms which express the protein. With respect to a nucleic acid, the term “recombinant” or “engineered” means having an altered nucleic acid sequence as a result of the application of genetic engineering techniques. Genetic engineering techniques include, but are not limited to, PCR and DNA cloning technologies; transfection, transformation and other gene transfer technologies; homologous recombination; site-directed mutagenesis; and gene fusion. In accordance with this definition, a protein having an amino acid sequence identical to a naturally-occurring protein, but produced by cloning and expression in a heterologous host, is not considered recombinant.
[0147]
As used herein, the term “wild-type” refers to the most common naturally occurring allele (i.e., polynucleotide sequence) in the allele population of the same type of gene, wherein a polypeptide encoded by the wild-type allele has its original functions. The term “wild-type” also refers to a polypeptide encoded by a wild-type allele. Wild-type alleles (i.e., polynucleotides) and polypeptides are distinguishable from mutant or variant alleles and polypeptides, which comprise one or more mutations and/or substitutions relative to the wild-type sequence(s). Whereas a wild-type allele or polypeptide can confer a normal phenotype in an organism, a mutant or variant allele or polypeptide can, in some instances, confer an altered phenotype. Wild-type nucleases are distinguishable from recombinant or non-naturally-occurring nucleases. The term “wild-type” can also refer to a cell, an organism, and/or a subject which possesses a wild-type allele of a particular gene, or a cell, an organism, and/or a subject used for comparative purposes.
[0148]
As used herein, the term “genetically-modified” refers to a cell or organism in which, or in an ancestor of which, a genomic DNA sequence has been deliberately modified by recombinant technology. As used herein, the term “genetically-modified” encompasses the term “transgenic.”
[0149]
As used herein with respect to recombinant proteins, the term “modification” means any insertion, deletion, or substitution of an amino acid residue in the recombinant sequence relative to a reference sequence (e.g., a wild-type or a native sequence).
[0150]
As used herein, the terms “recognition sequence” or “recognition site” refer to a DNA sequence that is bound and cleaved by an endonuclease. In the case of a meganuclease, a recognition sequence comprises a pair of inverted, 9 basepair “half sites” which are separated by four basepairs. In the case of a single-chain meganuclease, the N-terminal domain of the protein contacts a first half-site and the C-terminal domain of the protein contacts a second half-site. Cleavage by a meganuclease produces four basepair 3′ “overhangs”. “Overhangs,” or “sticky ends” are short, single-stranded DNA segments that can be produced by endonuclease cleavage of a double-stranded DNA sequence. In the case of meganucleases and single-chain meganucleases derived from I-CreI, the overhang comprises bases 10-13 of the 22 basepair recognition sequence.
[0151]
As used herein, the term “target site” or “target sequence” refers to a region of the chromosomal DNA of a cell comprising a recognition sequence for a nuclease.
[0152]
As used herein, the term “DNA-binding affinity” or “binding affinity” means the tendency of a meganuclease to non-covalently associate with a reference DNA molecule (e.g., a recognition sequence or an arbitrary sequence). Binding affinity is measured by a dissociation constant, Kd. As used herein, a nuclease has “altered” binding affinity if the Kd of the nuclease for a reference recognition sequence is increased or decreased by a statistically significant percent change, or biologically significant amount (e.g., at least 2×, or 2× to 10×), relative to a reference nuclease.
[0153]
As used herein, the term “specificity” means the ability of a nuclease to recognize and cleave double-stranded DNA molecules only at a particular sequence of base pairs referred to as the recognition sequence, or only at a particular set of recognition sequences. The set of recognition sequences will share certain conserved positions or sequence motifs, but may be degenerate at one or more positions. A highly-specific nuclease is capable of cleaving only one or a very few recognition sequences. Specificity can be determined by any method known in the art.
[0154]
As used herein, a meganuclease has “altered” specificity if it binds to and cleaves a recognition sequence which is not bound to and cleaved by a reference meganuclease (e.g., a wild-type) under physiological conditions, or if the rate of cleavage of a recognition sequence is increased or decreased by a biologically significant amount (e.g., at least 2×, or 2×-10×) relative to a reference meganuclease.
[0155]
In some embodiments, the presently disclosed engineered meganucleases have improved (i.e., increased) specificity for the target recognition sequence that comprises SEQ ID NO: 10 (i.e., HBV 11-12) as compared to the HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease (the amino acid sequence of which is set forth as SEQ ID NO: 14). Thus, in certain embodiments, the presently disclosed engineered meganucleases exhibit reduced off-target cleavage as compared to the HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease. Off-target cleavage by a meganuclease can be measured using any method known in the art, including for example, oligo capture analysis as described here, a T7 endonuclease (T7E) assay as described herein, digital PCR as described herein, targeted sequencing of particular off-target sites, exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, direct in situ breaks labeling enrichment on streptavidin and next-generation sequencing (BLESS), genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq), and linear amplification-mediated high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing (LAM-HTGTS) (see, e.g., Zischew ski et al. (2017), Biotechnology Advances 35(1):95-104, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety).
[0156]
As used herein, the term “homologous recombination” or “HR” refers to the natural, cellular process in which a double-stranded DNA-break is repaired using a homologous DNA sequence as the repair template (see, e.g. Cahill et al. (2006), Front. Biosci. 11:1958-1976). The homologous DNA sequence may be an endogenous chromosomal sequence or an exogenous nucleic acid that was delivered to the cell.
[0157]
As used herein, the term “non-homologous end-joining” or “NHEJ” refers to the natural, cellular process in which a double-stranded DNA-break is repaired by the direct joining of two non-homologous DNA segments (see, e.g. Cahill et al. (2006), Front. Biosci. 11:1958-1976). DNA repair by non-homologous end-joining is error-prone and frequently results in the untemplated addition or deletion of DNA sequences at the site of repair. In some instances, cleavage at a target recognition sequence results in NHEJ at a target recognition site. Nuclease-induced cleavage of a target site in the coding sequence of a gene followed by DNA repair by NHEJ can introduce mutations into the coding sequence, such as frameshift mutations, that disrupt gene function. Thus, engineered meganucleases can be used to effectively knock-out a gene in a population of cells.
[0158]
As used herein, “homology arms” or “sequences homologous to sequences flanking a meganuclease cleavage site” refer to sequences flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends of a nucleic acid molecule which promote insertion of the nucleic acid molecule into a cleavage site generated by a meganuclease. In general, homology arms can have a length of at least 50 base pairs, preferably at least 100 base pairs, and up to 2000 base pairs or more, and can have at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, or more, sequence homology to their corresponding sequences in the genome.
[0159]
As used herein with respect to both amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences, the terms “percent identity,” “sequence identity,” “percentage similarity,” “sequence similarity” and the like refer to a measure of the degree of similarity of two sequences based upon an alignment of the sequences which maximizes similarity between aligned amino acid residues or nucleotides, and which is a function of the number of identical or similar residues or nucleotides, the number of total residues or nucleotides, and the presence and length of gaps in the sequence alignment. A variety of algorithms and computer programs are available for determining sequence similarity using standard parameters. As used herein, sequence similarity is measured using the BLASTp program for amino acid sequences and the BLASTn program for nucleic acid sequences, both of which are available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and are described in, for example, Altschul et al. (1990), J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410; Gish and States (1993), Nature Genet. 3:266-272; Madden et al. (1996), Meth. Enzymol. 266:131-141; Altschul et al. (1997), Nucleic Acids Res. 25:33 89-3402); Zhang et al. (2000), J. Comput. Biol. 7(1-2):203-14. As used herein, percent similarity of two amino acid sequences is the score based upon the following parameters for the BLASTp algorithm: word size=3; gap opening penalty=−11; gap extension penalty=−1; and scoring matrix=BLOSUM62. As used herein, percent similarity of two nucleic acid sequences is the score based upon the following parameters for the BLASTn algorithm: word size=11; gap opening penalty=−5; gap extension penalty=−2; match reward=1; and mismatch penalty=−3.
[0160]
As used herein with respect to modifications of two proteins or amino acid sequences, the term “corresponding to” is used to indicate that a specified modification in the first protein is a substitution of the same amino acid residue as in the modification in the second protein, and that the amino acid position of the modification in the first protein corresponds to or aligns with the amino acid position of the modification in the second protein when the two proteins are subjected to standard sequence alignments (e.g., using the BLASTp program). Thus, the modification of residue “X” to amino acid “A” in the first protein will correspond to the modification of residue “Y” to amino acid “A” in the second protein if residues X and Y correspond to each other in a sequence alignment, and despite the fact that X and Y may be different numbers.
[0161]
As used herein, the term “recognition half-site,” “recognition sequence half-site,” or simply “half-site” means a nucleic acid sequence in a double-stranded DNA molecule which is recognized by a monomer of a homodimeric or heterodimeric meganuclease, or by one subunit of a single-chain meganuclease.
[0162]
As used herein, the term “hypervariable region” refers to a localized sequence within a meganuclease monomer or subunit that comprises amino acids with relatively high variability. A hypervariable region can comprise about 50-60 contiguous residues, about 53-57 contiguous residues, or preferably about 56 residues. In some embodiments, the residues of a hypervariable region may correspond to positions 24-79 or positions 215-270 of SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13. A hypervariable region can comprise one or more residues that contact DNA bases in a recognition sequence and can be modified to alter base preference of the monomer or subunit. A hypervariable region can also comprise one or more residues that bind to the DNA backbone when the meganuclease associates with a double-stranded DNA recognition sequence. Such residues can be modified to alter the binding affinity of the meganuclease for the DNA backbone and the target recognition sequence. In different embodiments of the invention, a hypervariable region may comprise between 1-20 residues that exhibit variability and can be modified to influence base preference and/or DNA-binding affinity. In particular embodiments, a hypervariable region comprises between about 15-20 residues that exhibit variability and can be modified to influence base preference and/or DNA-binding affinity.
[0163]
In some embodiments, variable residues within a hypervariable region correspond to one or more of positions 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 33, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 68, 70, 75, and 77 of SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13.
[0164]
In some embodiments, variable residues within a hypervariable region correspond to one or more of positions 215, 217, 219, 221, 223, 224, 229, 231, 233, 235, 237, 261, 266, and 268 of SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13. In some embodiments, variable residues within a hypervariable region further correspond to one or more of positions 239, 241, 263, and 264 of SEQ ID NO: 12, or one or more of positions 241, 262, 263, and 264 of SEQ ID NO: 13. In other embodiments, variable residues within a hypervariable region correspond to one or more of positions In other embodiments, variable residues within a hypervariable region correspond to one or more of positions 215, 217, 219, 221, 223, 224, 229, 231, 233, 235, 237, 239, 241, 259, 261, 262, 263, 264, 266, and 268 of SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13.

[0170]
As used herein, the terms “treatment” or “treating a subject” refers to the administration of an engineered meganuclease of the invention, or a nucleic acid encoding an engineered meganuclease of the invention to a subject infected with HBV for the purpose of slowing or stopping the rate of HBV proliferation of the virus by cleaving the genome of at least one HBV particle. Such treatment reduces or prevents transfection and replication of HBV in the subject, and provides either partial or complete relief of one or more symptoms of HBV in the subject. Means to assess alleviation of symptoms of HBV infection may include measurement of liver functions by determining levels of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or by measuring sero conversion, namely disappearance and/or reduction of the circulating HBeAg and/or HBsAg levels. Further, alleviation or reduction of symptoms of HBV can be determined by examining liver biopsies and measuring the level of tissue fibrosis by methods well known in the art. The number of circulating viral particles can be determined for example by measuring HBV DNA levels using PCR or by detecting HBsAg levels in the blood. The terms “treatment” or “treating a subject” can further refer to the administration of a cell (e.g., hepatocyte cell) comprising a nucleic acid encoding an engineered meganuclease, wherein the cell is delivered to a target tissue (e.g., liver) and produces the engineered meganuclease in an amount sufficient to treat an HBV infection in the subject, thereby resulting in either partial or complete relief of one or more symptoms of HBV.

In specific embodiments, an effective amount of the engineered meganuclease or pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein reduces the level or proliferation of HBV or reduces at least one symptom of HBV in a subject with an HBV infection.
[0174]
The term “gc/kg” or “gene copies/kilogram” refers to the number of copies of a nucleic acid encoding an engineered meganuclease described herein per weight in kilograms of a subject that is administered the nucleic acid encoding the engineered meganuclease.

As used herein, the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to convey that the invention may be practiced with the variable equal to any of the values within that range. Thus, for a variable which is inherently discrete, the variable can be equal to any integer value within the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. Similarly, for a variable which is inherently continuous, the variable can be equal to any real value within the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. As an example, and without limitation, a variable which is described as having values between 0 and 2 can take the values 0, 1 or 2 if the variable is inherently discrete, and can take the values 0.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or any other real values ≥0 and ≤2 if the variable is inherently continuous.
2.1 Principle of the Invention
[0177]
The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery of second-generation HBV 11-12 meganucleases which have improved properties when compared to first-generation HBV 11-12 meganucleases, such as improved (i.e., increased) specificity resulting in reduced off-target cutting, and enhanced (i.e., increased) efficiency of cleavage and indel formation at the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, particularly in cells comprising an integrated copy of the HBV genome.
[0178]
Like the first-generation HBV11-12x.26 meganuclease, the optimized, second-generation meganucleases of the invention recognize the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence (SEQ ID NO: 10) in the P gene of the Hepatitis B virus that encodes the viral DNA polymerase. The HBV 11-12 recognition sequence is conserved across at least HBV genotypes A-G (SEQ ID NOs: 3-9), which advantageously allows for the presently disclosed engineered meganucleases to target HBV infections around the globe.
[0179]
Cleavage at the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence can allow for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at the cleavage site and can disrupt expression of one or more viral proteins (e.g., viral DNA polymerase) due to NHEJ at the cleavage site that results in insertions, deletions, or frameshift mutations. Alternatively, cleavage of the HBV genome at the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence may promote degradation of the HBV genome and/or HBV cccDNA. Disruption of the expression of the viral protein(s) can reduce or eliminate the infection and/or proliferation of HBV.
[0180]
Additionally, cleavage at the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence can further allow for homologous recombination of exogenous nucleic acid sequences directly into the HBV genome to disrupt the expression of one or more viral proteins. For example, a “suicide gene” can be introduced into a HBV genome via homologous recombination.
[0181]
Thus, the present invention encompasses engineered meganucleases which recognize and cleave the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence within a HBV genome. The present invention also encompasses methods of using such engineered meganucleases in a pharmaceutical composition and in methods for treating HBV infection. Further, the invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising engineered meganuclease proteins, or nucleic acids encoding engineered meganucleases, and the use of such compositions for the treatment of HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
2.2 Optimized Meganucleases that Recognize and Cleave the HBV 11-12 Recognition Sequence within the Genome of HBV
[0182]
It is known in the art that it is possible to use a site-specific nuclease to make a DNA break in the genome of a virus, and that such a DNA break can result in permanent modification of the genome via NHEJ such that the HBV virion can no longer divide/replicate or infect human cells. Thus, in some embodiments, the invention can be practiced using engineered meganucleases.
[0183]
In particular embodiments, the nucleases used to practice the invention are single-chain meganucleases. A single-chain meganuclease comprises an N-terminal subunit and a C-terminal subunit joined by a linker peptide. Each of the two domains recognizes half of the recognition sequence (i.e., a recognition half-site) and the site of DNA cleavage is at the middle of the recognition sequence near the interface of the two subunits. DNA strand breaks are offset by four base pairs such that DNA cleavage by a meganuclease generates a pair of four base pair, 3′ single-strand overhangs.
[0184]
The engineered meganucleases of the invention have been engineered to recognize and cleave the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence (SEQ ID NO: 10). The HBV 11-12 recognition sequence is positioned within the P protein ORF of multiple HBV genotypes. The HBV 11-12 recognition sequence can at least be found in the genome of multiple HBV genotypes, including genotypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 3-9, respectively).
[0185]
Engineered meganucleases of the invention comprise a first subunit, comprising a first hypervariable (HVR1) region, and a second subunit, comprising a second hypervariable (HVR2) region. Further, the first subunit binds to a first recognition half-site in the recognition sequence (i.e., the HBV11 half-site), and the second subunit binds to a second recognition half-site in the recognition sequence (i.e., the HBV12 half-site). In embodiments where the engineered meganuclease is a single-chain meganuclease, the first and second subunits can be oriented such that the first subunit, which comprises the HVR1 region and binds the first half-site, is positioned as the N-terminal subunit, and the second subunit, which comprises the HVR2 region and binds the second half-site, is positioned as the C-terminal subunit. In alternative embodiments, the first and second subunits can be oriented such that the first subunit, which comprises the HVR1 region and binds the first half-site, is positioned as the C-terminal subunit, and the second subunit, which comprises the HVR2 region and binds the second half-site, is positioned as the N-terminal subunit. Exemplary engineered meganucleases that recognize and cleave the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence are provided in Table 1.

[0186]
In some embodiments, the presently disclosed engineered meganucleases exhibit at least one optimized characteristic in comparison to the first-generation meganuclease HBV 11-12x.26. Such optimized characteristics include improved (i.e. increased) specificity resulting in reduced off-target cutting, and enhanced (i.e., increased) efficiency of cleavage and indel (i.e., insertion or deletion) formation at the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, particularly in cells comprising an integrated copy of the HBV genome. Thus, in particular embodiments, the presently disclosed engineered meganucleases, when delivered to a population of HBV-infected target cells, is able to generate a greater percentage of virions or cells with a cleavage and/or indel in the HBV genome (either incorporated or unincorporated). In some of these embodiments, the population of HBV or target cells comprises at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or more of HBV or target cells comprising a cleavage and/or indel in the HBV genome (either incorporated or unincorporated). Cleavage and/or indel formation by a meganuclease can be measured using any method known in the art, including T7E assay, digital PCR, mismatch detection assays, mismatch cleavage assay, high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA), heteroduplex mobility assay, sequencing, and fluorescent PCR capillary gel electrophoresis (see, e.g., Zischewski et al. (2017) Biotechnology Advances 35(1):95-104, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety).
2.3 Methods for Delivering and Expressing Optimized Meganucleases
[0187]
Disclosed herein are methods for treating an HBV infection or HCC in a subject. Likewise, methods are provided for reducing the symptoms of an HBV infection and reducing the amount of HBV, reducing the rate of proliferation of HBV or treating HCC in a subject comprising administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an engineered meganuclease disclosed herein (or a nucleic acid encoding the engineered meganuclease or a cell expressing the engineered meganuclease). In the methods of the invention, an engineered meganuclease disclosed herein can be delivered to and/or expressed from DNA/RNA in target cells that can provide the engineered meganuclease to the HBV genome.
[0188]
Engineered meganucleases disclosed herein can be delivered into a cell in the form of protein or, preferably, as a nucleic acid encoding the engineered meganuclease. Such nucleic acid can be DNA (e.g., circular or linearized plasmid DNA or PCR products) or RNA (e.g., mRNA). For embodiments in which the engineered meganuclease coding sequence is delivered in DNA form, it should be operably linked to a promoter to facilitate transcription of the nuclease gene. Mammalian promoters suitable for the invention include constitutive promoters such as the cytomegalovirus early (CMV) promoter (Thomsen et al. (1984), Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 81(3):659-63) or the SV40 early promoter (Benoist and Chambon (1981), Nature. 290(5804):304-10) as well as inducible promoters such as the tetracycline-inducible promoter (Dingermann et al. (1992), Mol Cell Biol. 12(9):4038-45). An engineered meganuclease of the invention can also be operably linked to a synthetic promoter. Synthetic promoters can include, without limitation, the JeT promoter (WO 2002/012514). In specific embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence encoding an engineered meganuclease as disclosed herein can be operably linked to a liver-specific promoter. Examples of liver-specific promoters include, without limitation, human alpha-1 antitrypsin promoter, hybrid liver-specific promoter (hepatic locus control region from ApoE gene (ApoE-HCR) and a liver-specific alpha1-antitrypsin promoter), human thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) promoter, and apolipoprotein A-II promoter.
[0189]
In specific embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one engineered meganuclease is delivered on a recombinant DNA construct or expression cassette. For example, the recombinant DNA construct can comprise an expression cassette (i.e., “cassette”) comprising a promoter and a nucleic acid sequence encoding an engineered meganuclease described herein. In other embodiments, the recombinant DNA construct comprises at least a first cassette and a second cassette, wherein the first cassette comprises a promoter and a nucleic acid sequence encoding an engineered meganuclease described herein, and wherein the second cassette comprises a promoter and a nucleic acid sequence encoding a second engineered meganuclease which recognizes and cleaves a second recognition sequence which is present in a Hepatitis B virus genome but differs from SEQ ID NO: 10. Non-limiting examples of other recognition sequences within the genome of a Hepatitis B virus include the HBV 5-6 recognition sequence (set forth as SEQ ID NO: 21).
[0190]
In other embodiments, the recombinant DNA construct comprises a cassette comprising a promoter and a polycistronic nucleic acid sequence, wherein the promoter drives expression of the polycistronic nucleic acid sequence to generate a polycistronic mRNA described herein in a target cell.
[0191]
In some embodiments, mRNA encoding an engineered meganuclease is delivered to a cell because this reduces the likelihood that the gene encoding the engineered meganuclease will integrate into the genome of the cell. Such mRNA encoding an engineered meganuclease can be produced using methods known in the art such as in vitro transcription. In some embodiments, the mRNA is 5′ capped using 7-methyl-guanosine, anti-reverse cap analogs (ARCA) (U.S. Pat. No. 7,074,596), CleanCap® analogs such as Cap 1 analogs (Trilink, San Diego, Calif.), or enzymatically capped using vaccinia capping enzyme or similar. In some embodiments, the mRNA may be polyadenylated. The mRNA may contain various 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequence elements to enhance expression the encoded engineered meganuclease and/or stability of the mRNA itself. Such elements can include, for example, posttranslational regulatory elements such as a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranslational regulatory element. The mRNA may contain nucleoside analogs or naturally-occurring nucleosides, such as pseudouridine, 5-methylcytidine, N6-methyladenosine, 5-methyluridine, or 2-thiouridine. Additional nucleoside analogs include, for example, those described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,278,036.
[0192]
In particular embodiments, an mRNA encoding an engineered nuclease of the invention can be a polycistronic mRNA encoding two or more of the presently disclosed meganucleases which are simultaneously expressed in a cell. In some embodiments, a polycistronic mRNA can encode at least a first and a second engineered meganuclease, wherein the first engineered meganuclease is an engineered meganuclease described herein, and wherein the second engineered meganuclease recognizes and cleaves a second recognition sequence in the HBV genome that differs from SEQ ID NO: 10 (e.g., the HBV 5-6 recognition sequence), such that the HBV genome is cleaved at multiple sites. In some embodiments, a polycistronic mRNA can encode an engineered meganuclease described herein and at least one additional protein which induces a therapeutically beneficial effect in the cell. A polycistronic mRNA of the invention can comprise any element known in the art to allow for the translation of two or more genes from the same mRNA molecule including, but not limited to, an IRES element, a T2A element, a P2A element, an E2A element, and an F2A element.
[0193]
In another particular embodiment, a nucleic acid encoding an endonuclease of the invention can be introduced into the cell using a single-stranded DNA template. The single-stranded DNA can further comprise a 5′ and/or a 3′ AAV inverted terminal repeat (ITR) upstream and/or downstream of the sequence encoding the engineered meganuclease. In other embodiments, the single-stranded DNA can further comprise a 5′ and/or a 3′ homology arm upstream and/or downstream of the sequence encoding the engineered meganuclease.
[0194]
In another particular embodiment, genes encoding an endonuclease of the invention can be introduced into a cell using a linearized DNA template. In some examples, a plasmid DNA encoding an endonuclease can be digested by one or more restriction enzymes such that the circular plasmid DNA is linearized prior to being introduced into a cell.
[0195]
In some embodiments, the methods comprise delivering an engineered meganuclease described herein (or a nucleic acid encoding the same) and a nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence encoding a suicide gene and sequences homologous to sequences flanking the meganuclease cleavage site, wherein the engineered meganuclease recognizes and cleaves a recognition sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 10 within the Hepatitis B virus genome, thus cleaving the HBV genome, wherein the suicide gene is inserted into the cleaved HBV genome by homologous recombination.
[0196]
A suicide gene is a nucleic acid that encodes a product that causes cell death by itself or in the presence of other compounds. A representative example of such a suicide gene is one that encodes thymidine kinase of herpes simplex virus. Additional examples are genes that encode thymidine kinase of varicella zoster virus and the bacterial gene cytosine deaminase that can convert 5-fluorocytosine to the highly toxic compound 5-fluorouracil. Suicide genes also include as non-limiting examples genes that encode caspase-9, caspase-8, or cytosine deaminase. In some examples, caspase-9 can be activated using a specific chemical inducer of dimerization (CID). In some embodiments, the suicide gene is directly lethal to the HBV or a target cell (e.g., HCC cell). In some such embodiments, the directly lethal suicide gene encodes a toxic polypeptide or a pro-apoptotic protein. In some embodiments, the suicide gene is indirectly lethal to the target cell, and directs the subject's own immune system to kill the target cell. In some such embodiments, the indirectly lethal suicide gene encodes a cell surface protein which is recognized as foreign by the subject's immune system and is targeted by a humoral or cellular immune response. In other such embodiments, the indirectly lethal suicide gene encodes a polypeptide which is presented by an MHC Class I molecule, is recognized as foreign by the subject's immune system, and is targeted by a cytotoxic immune response.
[0197]
Purified meganuclease proteins can be delivered into cells to cleave genomic DNA by a variety of different mechanisms known in the art, including those further detailed herein below.
[0198]
The target tissue(s) for delivery of engineered meganucleases of the invention include, without limitation, cells of the liver, such as a hepatocyte cell or preferably a primary hepatocyte, more preferably a human hepatocyte or a human primary hepatocyte, a HepG2.2.15 or a HepG2-hNTCP cell. As discussed, meganucleases of the invention can be delivered as purified protein or as RNA or DNA encoding the meganuclease. In one embodiment, meganuclease proteins, or mRNA, or DNA vectors encoding meganucleases, are supplied to target cells (e.g., cells in the liver) via injection directly to the target tissue. Alternatively, meganuclease protein, mRNA, DNA, or cells expressing meganucleases can be delivered systemically via the circulatory system.
[0199]
In some embodiments, meganuclease proteins, DNA/mRNA encoding meganucleases, or cells expressing meganuclease proteins are formulated for systemic administration, or administration to target tissues, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in accordance with known techniques. See, e.g., Remington, The Science And Practice of Pharmacy (21st ed., Philadelphia, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2005). In the manufacture of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention, proteins/RNA/mRNA/cells are typically admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier can be a solid or a liquid, or both, and can be formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation.
[0200]
In some embodiments, about 1×1010 gc/kg to about 1×1014 gc/kg (e.g., 1×1010 gc/kg, 1×1011 gc/kg, 1×1012 gc/kg, 1×1013 gc/kg, or 1×1014 gc/kg) of a nucleic acid encoding the engineered meganuclease is administered to the subject. In some embodiments, at least about 1×1010 gc/kg, at least about 1×1011 gc/kg, at least about 1×1012 gc/kg, at least about 1×1013 gc/kg, or at least about 1×1014 gc/kg of a nucleic acid encoding the engineered meganuclease is administered to the subject. In some embodiments, about 1×1010 gc/kg to about 1×1011 gc/kg, about 1×1011 gc/kg to about 1×1012 gc/kg, about 1×1012 gc/kg to about 1×1013 gc/kg, or about 1×1013 gc/kg to about 1×1014 gc/kg of a nucleic acid encoding the engineered meganuclease is administered to the subject.
[0201]
In some embodiments, the subject is administered a lipid nanoparticle formulation with about 0.1 mg/kg to about 3 mg/kg of mRNA encoding an engineered meganuclease. In some embodiments, the subject is administered a lipid nanoparticle formulation with at least about 0.1 mg/kg, at least about 0.25 mg/kg, at least about 0.5 mg/kg, at least about 0.75 mg/kg, at least about 1.0 mg/kg, at least about 1.5 mg/kg, at least about 2.0 mg/kg, at least about 2.5 mg/kg, or at least about 3.0 mg/kg of mRNA encoding an engineered meganuclease. In some embodiments, the subject is administered a lipid nanoparticle formulation within about 0.1 mg/kg to about 0.25 mg/kg, about 0.25 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg, about 0.5 mg/kg to about 0.75 mg/kg, about 0.75 mg/kg to about 1.0 mg/kg, about 1.0 mg/kg to about 1.5 mg/kg, about 1.5 mg/kg to about 2.0 mg/kg, about 2.0 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, or about 2.5 mg/kg to about 3.0 mg/kg of mRNA encoding and engineered meganuclease.
[0202]
In some embodiments, meganuclease proteins, or DNA/mRNA encoding the meganuclease, are coupled to a cell penetrating peptide or targeting ligand to facilitate cellular uptake. Examples of cell penetrating peptides known in the art include poly-arginine (Jearawiriyapaisarn, et al. (2008) Mol Ther. 16:1624-9), TAT peptide from the HIV virus (Hudecz et al. (2005), Med. Res. Rev. 25: 679-736), MPG (Simeoni, et al. (2003) Nucleic Acids Res. 31:2717-2724), Pep-1 (Deshayes et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43: 7698-7706, and HSV-1 VP-22 (Deshayes et al. (2005) Cell Mol Life Sci. 62:1839-49. In an alternative embodiment, meganuclease proteins, or DNA/mRNA encoding meganucleases, are coupled covalently or non-covalently to an antibody that recognizes a specific cell-surface receptor expressed on target cells such that the meganuclease protein/DNA/mRNA binds to and is internalized by the target cells. Alternatively, meganuclease protein/DNA/mRNA can be coupled covalently or non-covalently to the natural ligand (or a portion of the natural ligand) for such a cell-surface receptor. (McCall, et al. (2014) Tissue Barriers. 2(4):e944449; Dinda, et al. (2013) Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 14:1264-74; Kang, et al. (2014) Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 15(3):220-30; Qian et al. (2014) Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 10(11):1491-508).
[0203]
In some embodiments, meganuclease proteins, or DNA/mRNA encoding meganucleases, are encapsulated within biodegradable hydrogels for injection or implantation within the desired region of the liver (e.g., in proximity to hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells or hematopoietic endothelial cells, or progenitor cells which differentiate into the same). Hydrogels can provide sustained and tunable release of the therapeutic payload to the desired region of the target tissue without the need for frequent injections, and stimuli-responsive materials (e.g., temperature- and pH-responsive hydrogels) can be designed to release the payload in response to environmental or externally applied cues (Kang Derwent et al. (2008) Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc. 106:206-214).
[0204]
In some embodiments, meganuclease proteins, or DNA/mRNA encoding meganucleases, are coupled covalently or, preferably, non-covalently to a nanoparticle or encapsulated within such a nanoparticle using methods known in the art (Sharma, et al. (2014) Biomed Res Int. 2014). A nanoparticle is a nanoscale delivery system whose length scale is <1 □m, preferably <100 nm. Such nanoparticles may be designed using a core composed of metal, lipid, polymer, or biological macromolecule, and multiple copies of the meganuclease proteins, mRNA, or DNA can be attached to or encapsulated with the nanoparticle core. This increases the copy number of the protein/mRNA/DNA that is delivered to each cell and, so, increases the intracellular expression of each meganuclease to maximize the likelihood that the target recognition sequences will be cut. The surface of such nanoparticles may be further modified with polymers or lipids (e.g., chitosan, cationic polymers, or cationic lipids) to form a core-shell nanoparticle whose surface confers additional functionalities to enhance cellular delivery and uptake of the payload (Jian et al. (2012) Biomaterials. 33(30): 7621-30). Nanoparticles may additionally be advantageously coupled to targeting molecules to direct the nanoparticle to the appropriate cell type and/or increase the likelihood of cellular uptake. Examples of such targeting molecules include antibodies specific for cell-surface receptors and the natural ligands (or portions of the natural ligands) for cell surface receptors.
[0205]
In some embodiments, the meganuclease proteins or DNA/mRNA encoding the meganucleases are encapsulated within liposomes or complexed using cationic lipids (see, e.g., LIPOFECTAMINE transfection reagent, Life Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.; Zuris et al. (2015) Nat Biotechnol. 33: 73-80; Mishra et al. (2011) J Drug Deliv. 2011:863734). The liposome and lipoplex formulations can protect the payload from degradation, enhance accumulation and retention at the target site, and facilitate cellular uptake and delivery efficiency through fusion with and/or disruption of the cellular membranes of the target cells.
[0206]
In some embodiments, meganuclease proteins, or DNA/mRNA encoding meganucleases, are encapsulated within polymeric scaffolds (e.g., PLGA) or complexed using cationic polymers (e.g., PEI, PLL) (Tamboli et al. (2011) Ther Deliv. 2(4): 523-536). Polymeric carriers can be designed to provide tunable drug release rates through control of polymer erosion and drug diffusion, and high drug encapsulation efficiencies can offer protection of the therapeutic payload until intracellular delivery to the desired target cell population.
[0207]
In some embodiments, meganuclease proteins, or DNA/mRNA encoding engineered meganucleases, are combined with amphiphilic molecules that self-assemble into micelles (Tong et al. (2007) J Gene Med. 9(11): 956-66). Polymeric micelles may include a micellar shell formed with a hydrophilic polymer (e.g., polyethyleneglycol) that can prevent aggregation, mask charge interactions, and reduce nonspecific interactions.
[0208]
In some embodiments, meganuclease proteins, or DNA/mRNA encoding meganucleases, are formulated into an emulsion or a nanoemulsion (i.e., having an average particle diameter of <1 nm) for administration and/or delivery to the target cell. The term “emulsion” refers to, without limitation, any oil-in-water, water-in-oil, water-in-oil-in-water, or oil-in-water-in-oil dispersions or droplets, including lipid structures that can form as a result of hydrophobic forces that drive apolar residues (e.g., long hydrocarbon chains) away from water and polar head groups toward water, when a water immiscible phase is mixed with an aqueous phase. These other lipid structures include, but are not limited to, unilamellar, paucilamellar, and multilamellar lipid vesicles, micelles, and lamellar phases. Emulsions are composed of an aqueous phase and a lipophilic phase (typically containing an oil and an organic solvent). Emulsions also frequently contain one or more surfactants. Nanoemulsion formulations are well known, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,015,832, 6,506,803, 6,635,676, 6,559,189, and 7,767,216, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[0209]
In some embodiments, meganuclease proteins, or DNA/mRNA encoding meganucleases, are covalently attached to, or non-covalently associated with, multifunctional polymer conjugates, DNA dendrimers, and polymeric dendrimers (Mastorakos et al. (2015) Nanoscale. 7(9): 3845-56; Cheng et al. (2008) J Pharm Sci. 97(1): 123-43). The dendrimer generation can control the payload capacity and size, and can provide a high drug payload capacity. Moreover, display of multiple surface groups can be leveraged to improve stability, reduce nonspecific interactions, and enhance cell-specific targeting and drug release.
[0210]
In some embodiments, genes encoding a meganuclease are delivered using a viral vector. Such vectors are known in the art and include retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, adenoviral vectors, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (reviewed in Vannucci, et al. (2013 New Microbiol. 36:1-22). In some embodiments, the viral vectors are injected directly into target tissues (e.g., liver tissue). In alternative embodiments, the viral vectors are delivered systemically via the circulatory system. It is known in the art that different AAV vectors tend to localize to different tissues. In liver target tissues, effective transduction of hepatocytes has been shown, for example, with AAV serotypes 2, 8, and 9 (Sands (2011) Methods Mol. Biol. 807:141-157). AAV vectors can also be self-complementary such that they do not require second-strand DNA synthesis in the host cell (McCarty, et al. (2001) Gene Ther. 8:1248-54).
[0211]
If the meganuclease genes are delivered in DNA form (e.g. plasmid) and/or via a viral vector (e.g. AAV) they must be operably linked to a promoter. In some embodiments, this can be a viral promoter such as endogenous promoters from the viral vector (e.g. the LTR of a lentiviral vector) or the well-known cytomegalovirus- or SV40 virus-early promoters. In a preferred embodiment, meganuclease genes are operably linked to a promoter that drives gene expression preferentially in the target cells. Examples of liver-specific promoters include, without limitation, human alpha-1 antitrypsin promoter, hybrid liver-specific promoter (hepatic locus control region from ApoE gene (ApoE-HCR) and a liver-specific alpha1-antitrypsin promoter), human thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) promoter, and apolipoprotein A-II promoter.
[0212]
In particular embodiments, the viral vector comprises a cassette comprising a promoter and a nucleic acid sequence encoding an engineered meganuclease described herein. The viral vector could also comprise two or more cassettes, wherein at least a first cassette comprises a promoter and a nucleic acid sequence encoding an engineered meganuclease described herein, and wherein at least a second cassette comprises a promoter and a nucleic acid sequence encoding an engineered meganuclease that has specificity for a different HBV recognition sequence other than the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence. In some embodiments, the viral vector comprises one cassette comprising a promoter and a polycistronic nucleic acid sequence, wherein the promoter drives expression of the polycistronic nucleic acid sequence to generate a polycistronic mRNA, such as polycistronic mRNA encoding an engineered meganuclease, described herein in a target cell.
[0213]
Methods and compositions are provided for delivering a meganuclease disclosed herein to the liver of a subject infected with HBV. In one embodiment, native hepatocytes which have been removed from the mammal can be transduced with a vector which encodes the engineered meganuclease. Alternatively, native hepatocytes of the HBV-infected subject can be transduced ex vivo with an adenoviral vector (i.e., an AAV vector) which encodes the engineered meganuclease and/or a molecule that stimulates liver regeneration, such as a hepatotoxin. Preferably the hepatotoxin is uPA, and has been modified to inhibit its secretion from the hepatocyte once expressed by the viral vector. In another embodiment, the vector encodes tPA, which can stimulate hepatocyte regeneration de novo. The transduced hepatocytes which have been removed from the mammal can then be returned to the mammal, where conditions are provided which are conducive to expression of the engineered meganuclease. Typically the transduced hepatocytes can be returned to the patient by infusion through the spleen or portal vasculature, and administration may be single or multiple over a period of 1 to 5 or more days.
[0214]
In an in vivo aspect of the methods of the invention, a retroviral, pseudotype or adenoviral associated vector (i.e., an AAV vector) is constructed which encodes the engineered meganuclease and is administered to the subject. Administration of a vector encoding the engineered meganuclease can occur with administration of an adenoviral vector that encodes a secretion-impaired hepatotoxin, or encodes tPA, which stimulates hepatocyte regeneration without acting as a hepatotoxin.
[0215]
Appropriate doses will depend, among other factors, on the specifics of any AAV vector chosen (e.g., serotype, etc.), on the route of administration, on the subject being treated (i.e., age, weight, sex, and general condition of the subject), and the mode of administration. Thus, the appropriate dosage may vary from patient to patient. An appropriate effective amount can be readily determined by one of skill in the art. Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. Moreover, the subject may be administered as many doses as appropriate. One of skill in the art can readily determine an appropriate number of doses. The dosage may need to be adjusted to take into consideration an alternative route of administration, or balance the therapeutic benefit against any side effects.
2.4 Pharmaceutical Compositions
[0216]
In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an engineered meganuclease of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid encoding an engineered meganuclease of the invention. In other embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a cell of the invention which can be delivered to a target tissue where the cell expresses the engineered meganuclease as disclosed herein. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be useful for treating a subject having HBV, reducing the level or proliferation of HBV, reducing at least one symptom of HBV, or treating HCC.
[0217]
Pharmaceutical compositions can be designed or selected according to the genotype of the target HBV strain. As described in detail herein, the meganucleases of the invention have been engineered to recognize and cleave a recognition sequence in specific genotypes of HBV. HBV 11-12 meganucleases (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 12 and 13), recognize and cleave the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence that is at least found in the genome of HBV genotypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 3-9, respectively). Further, recognition sequences of the engineered meganucleases disclosed herein can be found in isolates of HBV genotypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G that do not share 100% sequence identity to the respective genotype examples provided in SEQ ID NOs: 3-9. As used herein, HBV “isolates” can share at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or more sequence identity with the corresponding genotype example provided in any of SEQ ID NOs: 3-9. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein can be administered to a subject having any genotype of HBV comprising a recognition sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 10.
[0218]
Such pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared in accordance with known techniques. See, e.g., Remington, The Science And Practice of Pharmacy (21st ed., Philadelphia, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2005). In the manufacture of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention, meganuclease polypeptides (or DNA/RNA encoding the same or cells expressing the same) are typically admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and the resulting composition is administered to a subject. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the subject. In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can further comprise one or more additional agents or biological molecules useful in the treatment of a disease in the subject. Likewise, the additional agent(s) and/or biological molecule(s) can be co-administered as a separate composition.
[0219]
Given that the presently disclosed engineered meganucleases can have improved (i.e., increased) specificity resulting in reduced off-target cutting, and enhanced (i.e., increased) efficiency of cleavage and indel formation, particularly in cells comprising an integrated copy of the HBV genome, as compared to the HBV11-12x.26 meganuclease, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed pharmaceutical compositions comprising optimized engineered meganucleases, nucleic acid sequences encoding the same, or cells expressing the same, also have improved (i.e., increased) efficacy in treating HBV, reducing the level or proliferation of HBV, reducing at least one symptom of HBV, or treating HCC in a subject, when compared to the administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising the HBV11-12x.26 meganuclease.
[0220]
In particular embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can include combinations of the engineered meganucleases described herein (or nucleic acids encoding engineered meganucleases or cells expressing engineered meganucleases). In other embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can include at least two engineered meganucleases (or nucleic acids encoding engineered meganucleases or cells expressing engineered meganucleases), wherein at least a first engineered meganuclease is one described herein that recognizes and cleaves the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, and wherein at least a second engineered meganuclease recognizes and cleaves a second recognition sequence in the HBV genome other than the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, such that a single pharmaceutical composition is broadly useful for the treatment of a wide array of HBV genotypes and/or genotype isolates in a subject. Likewise, in other embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can include polycistronic mRNAs (or recombinant DNA constructs or viral vectors having cassettes which, when expressed, produce polycistronic mRNAs) that encode multiple engineered meganucleases described herein. In other embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can include polycistronic mRNAs (or recombinant DNA constructs or viral vectors having cassettes which, when expressed, produce polycistronic mRNAs) that encode at least two engineered meganucleases, wherein at least a first engineered meganuclease is one described herein that recognizes and cleaves the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, and wherein at least a second engineered meganuclease recognizes and cleaves a second recognition sequence in the HBV genome other than the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence. Such pharmaceutical compositions are also broadly useful for the treatment of a wide array of HBV genotypes and/or genotype isolates in a subject. In either case, such pharmaceutical compositions can be useful as a single treatment when the specific HBV genotype or isolate is known or unknown in the subject.
[0221]
For example, pharmaceutical compositions comprising multiple different engineered meganucleases (including at least one of the engineered meganucleases disclosed herein) or comprising nucleic molecules encoding multiple different engineered meganucleases (including at least one of the engineered meganucleases disclosed herein) that target recognition sequences within the HBV genome, can be administered to a patient infected with multiple genotypes of HBV, or infected with unknown genotypes of HBV. Accordingly, providing pharmaceutical compositions with multiple different engineered meganucleases or comprising nucleic molecules encoding multiple different engineered meganucleases affords a flexible option for treatment and control of HBV infection where resources do not allow for accurate genotyping HBV and where fast and broad treatment solutions are desired.
[0222]
In particular embodiments of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition can comprise one or more mRNAs described herein encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles, which are described elsewhere herein. In particular embodiments, lipid nanoparticles can comprise two or more mRNAs described herein. In other embodiments, lipid nanoparticles can comprise at least two mRNAs, wherein at least a first mRNA is an mRNA described herein that encodes an engineered meganuclease described herein that recognizes and cleaves the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, and wherein at least a second mRNA encodes a second engineered meganuclease that recognizes and cleaves a recognition sequence within an HBV genome other than the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence. In other embodiments, lipid nanoparticles can comprise one or more polycistronic mRNAs described herein, wherein each polycistronic mRNA encodes two or more engineered meganucleases, wherein at least one engineered meganuclease is an engineered meganuclease described herein that recognizes and cleaves the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, and wherein at least a second engineered meganuclease recognizes and cleaves a recognition sequence within a HBV genome other than the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence.
[0223]
Some lipid nanoparticles contemplated for use in the invention comprise at least one cationic lipid, at least one non-cationic lipid, and at least one conjugated lipid. In more particular examples, lipid nanoparticles can comprise from about 50 mol % to about 85 mol % of a cationic lipid, from about 13 mol % to about 49.5 mol % of a non-cationic lipid, and from about 0.5 mol % to about 10 mol % of a lipid conjugate, and are produced in such a manner as to have a non-lamellar (i.e., non-bilayer) morphology.

[0232]
In other embodiments, the composition may comprise amphoteric liposomes, which contain at least one positive and at least one negative charge carrier, which differs from the positive one, the isoelectric point of the liposomes being between 4 and 8. This objective is accomplished owing to the fact that liposomes are prepared with a pH-dependent, changing charge.
[0233]
Liposomal structures with the desired properties are formed, for example, when the amount of membrane-forming or membrane-based cationic charge carriers exceeds that of the anionic charge carriers at a low pH and the ratio is reversed at a higher pH. This is always the case when the ionizable components have a pKa value between 4 and 9. As the pH of the medium drops, all cationic charge carriers are charged more and all anionic charge carriers lose their charge.

2.5 Methods for Producing Recombinant Viral Vectors
[0245]
In some embodiments, the invention provides viral vectors (e.g., recombinant AAV vectors) for use in the methods of the invention. Recombinant AAV vectors are typically produced in mammalian cell lines such as HEK-293. Because the viral cap and rep genes are removed from the vector to prevent its self-replication to make room for the therapeutic gene(s) to be delivered (e.g. the meganuclease gene), it is necessary to provide these in trans in the packaging cell line. In addition, it is necessary to provide the “helper” (e.g. adenoviral) components necessary to support replication (Cots et al. (2013), Curr. Gene Ther. 13(5): 370-81). Frequently, recombinant AAV vectors are produced using a triple-transfection in which a cell line is transfected with a first plasmid encoding the “helper” components, a second plasmid comprising the cap and rep genes, and a third plasmid comprising the viral ITRs containing the intervening DNA sequence to be packaged into the virus. Viral particles comprising a genome (ITRs and intervening gene(s) of interest) encased in a capsid are then isolated from cells by freeze-thaw cycles, sonication, detergent, or other means known in the art. Particles are then purified using cesium-chloride density gradient centrifugation or affinity chromatography and subsequently delivered to the gene(s) of interest to cells, tissues, or an organism such as a human patient.
[0246]
Because recombinant AAV particles are typically produced (manufactured) in cells, precautions must be taken in practicing the current invention to ensure that the engineered meganuclease is not expressed in the packaging cells. Because the viral genomes of the invention may comprise a recognition sequence for the meganuclease, any meganuclease expressed in the packaging cell line may be capable of cleaving the viral genome before it can be packaged into viral particles. This will result in reduced packaging efficiency and/or the packaging of fragmented genomes. Several approaches can be used to prevent meganuclease expression in the packaging cells, including:
[0247]
The meganuclease can be placed under the control of a tissue-specific promoter that is not active in the packaging cells. For example, if a viral vector is developed for delivery of (a) meganuclease gene(s) to muscle tissue, a muscle-specific promoter can be used. Examples of muscle-specific promoters include C5-12 (Liu, et al. (2004) Hum Gene Ther. 15:783-92), the muscle-specific creatine kinase (MCK) promoter (Yuasa, et al. (2002) Gene Ther. 9:1576-88), or the smooth muscle 22 (SM22) promoter (Haase, et al. (2013) BMC Biotechnol. 13:49-54). Examples of CNS (neuron)-specific promoters include the NSE, Synapsin, and MeCP2 promoters (Lentz, et al. (2012) Neurobiol Dis. 48:179-88). Examples of liver-specific promoters include albumin promoters (such as Palb), human al-antitrypsin (such as PalAT), and hemopexin (such as Phpx) (Kramer et al., (2003) Mol. Therapy 7:375-85), hybrid liver-specific promoter (hepatic locus control region from ApoE gene (ApoE-HCR) and a liver-specific alpha1-antitrypsin promoter), human thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) promoter, and apolipoprotein A-II promoter. Examples of eye-specific promoters include opsin, and corneal epithelium-specific K12 promoters (Martin et al. (2002) Methods (28): 267-75) (Tong et al., (2007) J Gene Med, 9:956-66). These promoters, or other tissue-specific promoters known in the art, are not highly-active in HEK-293 cells and, thus, will not be expected to yield significant levels of meganuclease gene expression in packaging cells when incorporated into viral vectors of the present invention. Similarly, the viral vectors of the present invention contemplate the use of other cell lines with the use of incompatible tissue specific promoters (i.e., the well-known HeLa cell line (human epithelial cell) and using the liver-specific hemopexin promoter). Other examples of tissue specific promoters include: synovial sarcomas PDZD4 (cerebellum), C6 (liver), ASB5 (muscle), PPP1R12B (heart), SLC5A12 (kidney), cholesterol regulation APOM (liver), ADPRHL1 (heart), and monogenic malformation syndromes TP73L (muscle). (Jacox et al., (2010), PLoS One v.5(8):e12274).
[0248]
Alternatively, the vector can be packaged in cells from a different species in which the meganuclease is not likely to be expressed. For example, viral particles can be produced in microbial, insect, or plant cells using mammalian promoters, such as the well-known cytomegalovirus- or SV40 virus-early promoters, which are not active in the non-mammalian packaging cells. In a preferred embodiment, viral particles are produced in insect cells using the baculovirus system as described by Gao, et al. (Gao et al. (2007), J. Biotechnol. 131(2):138-43). A meganuclease under the control of a mammalian promoter is unlikely to be expressed in these cells (Airenne et al. (2013), Mol. Ther. 21(4):739-49). Moreover, insect cells utilize different mRNA splicing motifs than mammalian cells. Thus, it is possible to incorporate a mammalian intron, such as the human growth hormone (HGH) intron or the SV40 large T antigen intron, into the coding sequence of a meganuclease. Because these introns are not spliced efficiently from pre-mRNA transcripts in insect cells, insect cells will not express a functional meganuclease and will package the full-length genome. In contrast, mammalian cells to which the resulting recombinant AAV particles are delivered will properly splice the pre-mRNA and will express functional meganuclease protein. Haifeng Chen has reported the use of the HGH and SV40 large T antigen introns to attenuate expression of the toxic proteins barnase and diphtheria toxin fragment A in insect packaging cells, enabling the production of recombinant AAV vectors carrying these toxin genes (Chen, H (2012) Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 1(11): e57).
[0249]
The meganuclease gene can be operably linked to an inducible promoter such that a small-molecule inducer is required for meganuclease expression. Examples of inducible promoters include the Tet-On system (Clontech; Chen et al. (2015), BMC Biotechnol. 15(1):4)) and the RheoSwitch system (Intrexon; Sowa et al. (2011), Spine, 36(10): E623-8). Both systems, as well as similar systems known in the art, rely on ligand-inducible transcription factors (variants of the Tet Repressor and Ecdysone receptor, respectively) that activate transcription in response to a small-molecule activator (Doxycycline or Ecdysone, respectively). Practicing the current invention using such ligand-inducible transcription activators includes: 1) placing the meganuclease gene under the control of a promoter that responds to the corresponding transcription factor, the meganuclease gene having (a) binding site(s) for the transcription factor; and 2) including the gene encoding the transcription factor in the packaged viral genome The latter step is necessary because the meganuclease will not be expressed in the target cells or tissues following recombinant AAV delivery if the transcription activator is not also provided to the same cells. The transcription activator then induces meganuclease gene expression only in cells or tissues that are treated with the cognate small-molecule activator. This approach is advantageous because it enables meganuclease gene expression to be regulated in a spatio-temporal manner by selecting when and to which tissues the small-molecule inducer is delivered. However, the requirement to include the inducer in the viral genome, which has significantly limited carrying capacity, creates a drawback to this approach.
[0250]
In another preferred embodiment, recombinant AAV particles are produced in a mammalian cell line that expresses a transcription repressor that prevents expression of the meganuclease. Transcription repressors are known in the art and include the Tet-Repressor, the Lac-Repressor, the Cro repressor, and the Lambda-repressor. Many nuclear hormone receptors such as the ecdysone receptor also act as transcription repressors in the absence of their cognate hormone ligand. To practice the current invention, packaging cells are transfected/transduced with a vector encoding a transcription repressor and the meganuclease gene in the viral genome (packaging vector) is operably linked to a promoter that is modified to comprise binding sites for the repressor such that the repressor silences the promoter. The gene encoding the transcription repressor can be placed in a variety of positions. It can be encoded on a separate vector; it can be incorporated into the packaging vector outside of the ITR sequences; it can be incorporated into the cap/rep vector or the adenoviral helper vector; or it can be stably integrated into the genome of the packaging cell such that it is expressed constitutively. Methods to modify common mammalian promoters to incorporate transcription repressor sites are known in the art. For example, Chang and Roninson modified the strong, constitutive CMV and RSV promoters to comprise operators for the Lac repressor and showed that gene expression from the modified promoters was greatly attenuated in cells expressing the repressor (Chang and Roninson (1996), Gene 183:137-42). The use of a non-human transcription repressor ensures that transcription of the meganuclease gene will be repressed only in the packaging cells expressing the repressor and not in target cells or tissues transduced with the resulting recombinant AAV vector.

[0251]
Embodiments of the invention encompass the engineered meganucleases described herein, and variants thereof. Further embodiments of the invention encompass polynucleotides comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding the meganucleases described herein, and variants of such polynucleotides.
[0252]
As used herein, “variants” is intended to mean substantially similar sequences. A “variant” polypeptide is intended to mean a polypeptide derived from the “native” polypeptide by deletion or addition of one or more amino acids at one or more internal sites in the native protein and/or substitution of one or more amino acids at one or more sites in the native polypeptide. As used herein, a “native” polynucleotide or polypeptide comprises a parental sequence from which variants are derived. Variant polypeptides encompassed by the embodiments are biologically active. That is, they continue to possess the desired biological activity of the native protein; i.e., the ability to recognize and cleave the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence (SEQ ID NO: 10) within the genome of a Hepatitis B virus, and in some embodiments, exhibit at least one improved property over the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease, such as improved (i.e., increased) specificity and enhanced (i.e., increased) efficiency of cleavage and indel formation. Such variants may result, for example, from human manipulation. Biologically active variants of a native polypeptide of the embodiments (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 12 and 13), or biologically active variants of the recognition half-site binding subunits described herein, will have at least about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, or about 99%, sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of the native polypeptide or native subunit, as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein. A biologically active variant of a polypeptide or subunit of the embodiments may differ from that polypeptide or subunit by as few as about 1-40 amino acid residues, as few as about 1-20, as few as about 1-10, as few as about 5, as few as 4, 3, 2, or even 1 amino acid residue.
[0253]
The polypeptides of the embodiments may be altered in various ways including amino acid substitutions, deletions, truncations, and insertions. Methods for such manipulations are generally known in the art. For example, amino acid sequence variants can be prepared by mutations in the DNA. Methods for mutagenesis and polynucleotide alterations are well known in the art. See, for example, Kunkel (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488-492; Kunkel et al. (1987) Methods in Enzymol. 154:367-382; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,192; Walker and Gaastra, eds. (1983) Techniques in Molecular Biology (MacMillan Publishing Company, New York) and the references cited therein. Guidance as to appropriate amino acid substitutions that do not affect biological activity of the protein of interest may be found in the model of Dayhoff et al. (1978) Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure (Natl. Biomed. Res. Found., Washington, D.C.), herein incorporated by reference. Conservative substitutions, such as exchanging one amino acid with another having similar properties, may be optimal.

In some embodiments, engineered meganucleases of the invention can comprise variants of the HVR1 and HVR2 regions disclosed herein. Parental HVR regions can comprise, for example, residues 24-79 or residues 215-270 of the exemplified engineered meganucleases. Thus, variant HVRs can comprise an amino acid sequence having at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or more, sequence identity to an amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 24-79 or residues 215-270 of the engineered meganucleases exemplified herein, such that the variant HVR regions maintain the biological activity of the engineered meganuclease (i.e., binding to and cleaving the recognition sequence). Further, in some embodiments of the invention, a variant HVR1 region or variant HVR2 region can comprise residues corresponding to the amino acid residues found at specific positions within the parental HVR. In this context, “corresponding to” means that an amino acid residue in the variant HVR is the same amino acid residue (i.e., a separate identical residue) present in the parental HVR sequence in the same relative position (i.e., in relation to the remaining amino acids in the parent sequence). By way of example, if a parental HVR sequence comprises a serine residue at position 26, a variant HVR that “comprises a residue corresponding to” residue 26 will also comprise a serine at a position that is relative (i.e., corresponding) to parental position 26.
[0255]
In particular embodiments, engineered meganucleases of the invention comprise an HVR1 region that has at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or more sequence identity to an amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 215-270 of SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13.
[0256]
In certain embodiments, engineered meganucleases of the invention comprise an HVR2 region that has at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or more sequence identity to an amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 24-79 of SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13.
[0257]
In other particular embodiments, engineered meganucleases of the invention comprise an HVR1 region that has at least 86% sequence identity to an amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 215-270 of SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13 and an HVR2 region that has at least 97% sequence identity to an amino acid sequence corresponding to residues 24-79 of SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13.
[0258]
A substantial number of amino acid modifications to the DNA recognition domain of the wild-type I-CreI meganuclease have previously been identified (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 8,021,867) which, singly or in combination, result in engineered meganucleases with specificities altered at individual bases within the DNA recognition sequence half-site, such that the resulting rationally-designed meganucleases have half-site specificities different from the wild-type enzyme. Table 2 provides potential substitutions that can be made in an engineered meganuclease monomer or subunit to enhance specificity based on the base present at each half-site position (−1 through −9) of a recognition half-site.

Although the effects of multiple amino substitutions in the HVR regions are not independent, the data of Table 2 provides possible substitutions in the disclosed HVR regions of SEQ ID NO: 12 and 13 which can be relatively conservative in their effects on specificity. For example, in the HVR1 regions of both SEQ ID NO: 12 and 13, the R residue corresponding to I-CreI position 46, which contacts an A at position −1 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with C46 or A46 (which have a preference for contacting A), or G46 (which is relatively neutral in preference); the W residue corresponding to I-CreI position 70, which contacts an A at position −1 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with G70, A70 or S70 (which are relatively neutral in preference); the N residue corresponding to I-CreI position 44, which contacts a C at position −2 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with K44 or R44 (which have a preference for contacting C); the I residue corresponding to I-CreI position 68, which contacts a G at position −3 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with R68 (which has a preference for contacting G), or K68 (which has a preference for contacting G or T); the S residue corresponding to I-CreI position 26, which contacts a C at position −4 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with K26 (which has a preference for contacting A), Q26 (which has a preference for C or T), or S26 (which is relatively neutral in preference); the I residue corresponding to I-CreI position 42, which contacts a C at position −5 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with E42 (which has a preference for contacting C); the R residue corresponding to I-CreI position 28, which contacts a T at position −6 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with Q28 (which has a preference for contacting T), or S28 (which is relatively neutral in preference); the E residue corresponding to I-CreI position 40, which contacts a T at position −6 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with C40, 140 or V40 (which have a preference for T), or A40 (which has a preference for A or T) or S40 (which is relatively neutral in preference); the R residue corresponding to I-CreI position 30, which contacts a T at position −7 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with Q30 (which is relatively neutral in preference); the A residue corresponding to I-CreI position 33, which contacts a G at position −8 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with H33 (which has a preference for contacting G), F33 (which has a preference for contacting A, G or T), or R33 (which has a preference for contacting A or G); and the H residue corresponding to I-CreI position 32, which contacts an A at position −9 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 11, could be replaced with S32, N32, Q32 or T32 (which are relatively neutral in preference).
[0260]
Similarly, in the HVR2 regions of both SEQ ID NO: 12 and 13, the G residue corresponding to I-CreI position 46, which contacts a C at position −1 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with H46, K46 or R46 (which have a preference for contacting C), or T46 (which has a preference for contacting contacts C or T); the N residue corresponding to I-CreI position 70, which contacts a C at position −1 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with R70, which has a preference for contacting C), or G70, A70 or S70 (which are relatively neutral in preference); the E residue corresponding to I-CreI position 44, which contacts a C at position −2 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with the similarly negative residue D44 (which has a preference for contacting G) or K44 or R44 (which are positive residues that have a preference for contacting C); the Y residue corresponding to I-CreI position 68, which contacts a T at position −3 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with M68, C68, L68 or F68 (which have a preference for contacting T), or K68 (which has a preference for contacting G or T); the Q residue corresponding to I-CreI position 26, which contacts an A at position −4 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with A26 (which has a preference for contacting A) or S26 (which is relatively neutral in preference); the R residue corresponding to I-CreI position 42, which contacts a G at position −5 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with Q42 (which has a preference for contacting A or G); the A residue corresponding to I-CreI position 28, which contacts a C at position −6 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with R28 (which has a preference for C), or S28 (which is relatively neutral in preference); the K residue corresponding to I-CreI position 40, which contacts a C at position −6 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with S40 (which is relatively neutral in preference); the R residue corresponding to I-CreI position 30, which contacts a C at position −7 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with K30 (which has a preference for contacting C) or Q30 (which is relatively neutral in preference); the F residue corresponding to I-CreI position 33, which contacts a G at position −8 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with H33 (which has a preference for contacting G) or R33 (which has a preference for contacting A or G); and the S residue corresponding to I-CreI position 32, which contacts a T at position −9 of the recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, could be replaced with L32, V32, A32, C32 (which have a preference for contacting T), D32 or 132 (which have a preference for contacting C or T) or N32, H32, Q32 or T32 (which are relatively neutral in preference).
[0261]
These variants can be tested alone and/or in combination to select variants with desired specificity and/or activity using methods described herein and known in the art. Such variants are within the scope of the invention, although the preferred embodiments are disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 12 and 13.
[0262]
In addition, modifications can be made in an engineered meganuclease monomer or subunit to modulate DNA-binding affinity and/or activity. For example, an engineered meganuclease monomer or subunit described herein can comprise a G, S, or A at a residue corresponding to position 19 of I-CreI or SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13 (WO 2009/001159), a Y, R, K, or D at a residue corresponding to position 66 of I-CreI or SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13, and/or an E, Q, or K at a residue corresponding to position 80 of I-CreI or SEQ ID NO: 12 or 13 (U.S. Pat. No. 8,021,867).
[0263]
For polynucleotides, a “variant” comprises a deletion and/or addition of one or more nucleotides at one or more sites within the native polynucleotide. One of skill in the art will recognize that variants of the nucleic acids of the embodiments will be constructed such that the open reading frame is maintained. For polynucleotides, conservative variants include those sequences that, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode the amino acid sequence of one of the polypeptides of the embodiments. Variant polynucleotides include synthetically derived polynucleotides, such as those generated, for example, by using site-directed mutagenesis but which still encode a recombinant nuclease of the embodiments. Generally, variants of a particular polynucleotide of the embodiments will have at least about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99% or more sequence identity to that particular polynucleotide as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein. Variants of a particular polynucleotide of the embodiments (i.e., the reference polynucleotide) can also be evaluated by comparison of the percent sequence identity between the polypeptide encoded by a variant polynucleotide and the polypeptide encoded by the reference polynucleotide.
[0264]
The deletions, insertions, and substitutions of the variant protein sequences encompassed herein are not expected to produce radical changes in the characteristics of the polypeptide. However, when it is difficult to predict the exact effect of the substitution, deletion, or insertion in advance of doing so, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the effect will be evaluated by screening the polypeptide for its ability to preferentially recognize and cleave the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence within the genome of a Hepatitis B virus.

Example 1
Characterization of Meganucleases Having Specificity for the HBV 11-12 Recognition Sequence
[0342]
1. Meganucleases that Recognize and Cleave the HBV 11-12 Recognition Sequence
[0343]
The second-generation HBV 11-12 meganucleases, referred to as HBV 11-12L.363 (SEQ ID NO: 12) and HBV 11-12L.367 (SEQ ID NO: 13), were engineered to recognize and cleave the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence (SEQ ID NO: 10), which is present in multiple Hepatitis B virus genotypes, including genotypes A-G (SEQ ID NOs: 3-9, respectively). Each of these second-generation meganucleases comprises an N-terminal nuclease-localization signal derived from SV40, a first meganuclease subunit, a linker sequence, and a second meganuclease subunit. A first subunit in each HBV 11-12 meganuclease binds to the HBV11 recognition half-site of SEQ ID NO: 10, while a second subunit binds to the HBV12 recognition half-site (see, FIG. 2). HBV11-binding subunits and HBV12-binding subunits each comprise a 56 base pair hypervariable region, referred to as HVR1 and HVR2, respectively.
[0344]
The HVR1 region of each HBV11-binding subunit consists of residues 215-270 of SEQ ID NOs: 12 and 13. HBV11-binding subunits of HBV 11-12L.363 and HBV 11-12L.367 are identical to one another outside of the HVR1 region. The HVR1 region of each HBV 11-12 meganuclease comprises modifications relative to the wild-type I-CreI sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) at positions 215, 217, 219, 221, 223, 224, 229, 231, 233, 235, 237, 239, 241, 259, 261, 263, 264, 266, and 268. The glycine at residue 262 is unmodified in HBV 11-12L.363 and modified to an arginine in HBV 11-12L.367. Although not modified relative to wild-type I-CreI in HBV 11-12L.363, this residue is believed to contribute, in combination with the modified HVR1 residues, to specificity of the nuclease. The HVR1 regions of HBV 11-12L.363 and HBV 11-12L.367 each share 85.71% sequence identity to the HVR1 region of the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease.
[0345]
The HVR2 region of each HBV12-binding subunit consists of residues 24-79 of SEQ ID NOs: 12 and 13. HBV12-binding subunits of HBV 11-12L.363 and HBV 11-12L.367 are identical to one another outside of the HVR2 region. The HVR2 region of each HBV 11-12 meganuclease comprises modifications relative to the wild-type I-CreI sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) at positions 24, 26, 28, 30, 33, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 68, 70, 75, and 77. Although not modified relative to wild-type I-CreI, the serine residue at position 32 of SEQ ID NOs: 12 and 13 is believed to contribute, in combination with the modified HVR2 residues, to specificity of the nuclease. The HVR2 region of HBV 11-12L.363 and HBV 11-12L.367 each share 96.43% sequence identity to the HVR2 region of the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease.
2. Optimization of First-Generation HBV 11-12 Nucleases
[0346]
The first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease was evaluated for sequence specificity using a method very similar to GUIDE-seq (Tsai et al. (2015), Nat Biotechnology 33:187-197) but adjusted to find potential off-target sites for meganucleases. In general, potential off-target sites were identified by capturing a probe oligonucleotide in the double strand DNA break. The HBV nucleases generate a four base pair 3′ overhang so the probe oligo also contains randomized four base pair overhangs to improve ligation efficiency at sites more likely created by the nuclease cleavage. Specificity analysis of HBV 11-12x.26 in HEK 293 cells highlighted a number of positions within the protein-DNA interface that were not discriminating the correct sequence adequately. A library to address all of the problem interfaces would be too large to build and screen in our selection system so, instead, half sites were optimized sequentially. The HBV 11-12 single-chain meganuclease has the monomers fused in an orientation where the HBV12-binding subunit is in the N-terminus and the HBV11-binding subunit is in the C-terminus. Optimization of HBV11 began with re-randomizing amino acids in positions that dictate recognition site specificity. The library was sequentially positively and negatively selected against the intended site and the off-target, HBV11 Off: 5′-TtCCtccCCATACTGCGGAACT-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 23). Nucleases were evaluated using an integrated iGFFP assay (as described below) to determine on versus off target cleavage. Four promising nucleases, HBV 11-12L.188, L.190, L.206, and L.271, were re-evaluated in the oligo capture assay. Based on the reduction in read count and number of off-targets, L.188 and L.190 were chosen for subsequent library development. Positions in both the HBV11 and HBV12-binding subunits that contribute to recognition site specificity were randomized in this round of optimization. The libraries were simultaneously positively and negatively selected against the intended target site and either HBV11 Off or HBV12 Off: 5′-TGCCGATCCATACTGatGAAaa-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 24). The off-targets were alternated between successive rounds of selection. A 96-well plate of individual answers (i.e., nucleases) was evaluated for each library in the iGFFP assay (described below) against the intended site and both off-target sites. Two nucleases, HBV 11-12L.363 and L.367, were identified for further testing and were confirmed by full iGFFP testing (described below) that looks at toxicity of the nuclease over a 7 day period. These optimized nucleases were also evaluated for off-target specificity in the oligo capture assay. Finally, identified potential off-targets were verified using PCR amplification of the off-target and next generation sequencing to measure the frequency of indels at the potential off-target site.
3. Evaluation of HBV 11-12 Recognition Sequence Cleavage and Off-Target Cutting
[0347]
To determine whether HBV 11-12 meganucleases could recognize and cleave the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence (SEQ ID NO: 10), each HBV 11-12 meganuclease was evaluated using the CHO cell reporter assay previously described (see WO 2012/167192, FIG. 5). To perform the assay, a pair of CHO cell reporter lines were produced which carried a non-functional Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene expression cassette integrated into the genome of the cell. The GFP gene in each cell line was interrupted by a pair of recognition sequences such that intracellular cleavage of either recognition sequence by a meganuclease would stimulate a homologous recombination event resulting in a functional GFP gene. In both cell lines, one of the recognition sequences was derived from the HBV 11-12 target and the second recognition sequence was specifically recognized by a control meganuclease called “CHO 23/24”. CHO reporter cells comprising the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence (SEQ ID NO: 10) and the CHO 23/24 recognition sequence are referred to herein as “HBV 11-12 cells.”
[0348]
HBV 11-12 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding HBV 11-12L.363 or HBV 11-12L.367, or encoding the CHO 23/24 meganuclease. 4×105 CHO cells were transfected with 50 ng of plasmid DNA in a 96-well plate using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 hours post-transfection, cells were evaluated by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of GFP-positive cells compared to an untransfected negative control (1-2 bs). Both HBV 11-12 meganucleases were found to produce GFP-positive cells in cell lines comprising the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence at frequencies significantly exceeding the negative control and exceeding the CHO 23/24 positive control, indicating that each HBV 11-12 meganuclease was able to efficiently recognize and cleave the intended HBV 11-12 recognition sequence in a cell (see, FIG. 6).
[0349]
Alternatively, the HBV 11-12 meganucleases were also transfected into “HBV11 Off” or “HBV12 Off” cells which contain one of the counter selected off-target sequences between the GFP direct repeats. Unlike the intended target site in HBV 11-12 CHO cells, a desirable nuclease in HBV11 Off or HBV12 Off CHO cells has only background level GFP positive cells because it is able to discriminate against cutting the off-target sequence. The CHO 23-24 target site acts as a positive control in these experiments, demonstrating that the GFP can still be produced if the target site is cut by the CHO 23-24 nuclease. The new nucleases demonstrated a significantly improved (i.e., increased) discrimination against the HBV11 Off (FIG. 7) and HBV12 Off (FIG. 8) recognition sequences compared to the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease.
[0350]
The efficacy of HBV 11-12L.363 and L.367 meganucleases was also determined in a time- dependent manner 2, 5, and 7 days after introduction of the meganucleases into HBV 11-12 cells. In this study, HBV 11-12 cells (1.0×106) were electroporated with 1×106 copies of meganuclease mRNA per cell using a BioRad Gene Pulser Xcell according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 hours post-transfection, cells were evaluated by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of GFP-positive cells. A CHO 23/24 meganuclease was also included at each time point as a positive control. Each of the meganucleases showed a superior GFP-positive percentage relative to CHO 23-24 and the percent GFP continued to increase over the course of the experiment, indicating no gross toxicity to the cells (FIG. 9).
[0351]
The extended iGFFP assay was also used to evaluate the same group of meganucleases for discrimination against the two off targets, HBV11 Off and HBV12 Off, over a 7 day period. In this case, cells containing either HBV11 Off or HBV12 Off, and CHO 23-24, were electroporated with 1×106 copies of meganuclease mRNA per cell using a BioRad Gene Pulser Xcell according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 2, 5, and 7 days post-transfection, cells were evaluated by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of GFP-positive cells. A CHO 23/24 meganuclease was also included at each time point as a positive control. Each of the nucleases showed excellent discrimination against both off-targets over the period observed (FIGS. 10A and 10B).
4. Oligo Capture Assay and Analysis of Off-Target Cutting
[0352]
In these studies, an oligo capture assay was used to identify off target cutting induced by the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease and the optimized meganucleases HBV 11-12L.188, HBV 11-12L.363, and HBV 11-12L.367. Off target cutting was first assessed in HepG2 cells which lack the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence in their genome. Off target cutting was then assessed in a lentivirus-modified HepG2 cell line that comprises in its genome a partial HBV genome comprising the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence.
[0353]
Similar to GUIDE-seq, the oligo capture assay identifies potential off-target sites produced by the HBV 11-12 meganucleases by capturing an oligonucleotide at break sites within the cell's genomic DNA. GUIDE-seq was developed for CRISPR-Cas9 generated DNA breaks and there are a few key modifications to the chemistry and analysis in order to apply this technique to the present nucleases. Unlike CRISPR-cas9, the engineered meganucleases of the invention generate a four base pair 3′ overhang. To accommodate for this difference, the oligonucleotides used in oligo capture have randomized four base pair overhangs that could be compatible with the overhangs generated with the HBV 11-12 meganuclease. A higher frequency of insertion is observed due to the greater efficiency of ligating sticky ends rather than blunt ends. Cells were transfected with mRNA encoding the nuclease and the double stranded DNA oligonucleotides. After two days, the genomic DNA from these cells was isolated and sonicated to shear the DNA to smaller sizes. An oligonucleotide adapter was ligated to the sheared DNA and PCR was used to amplify any DNA pieces that contain an adapter at one end and the captured oligonucleotide at the other end. The amplified DNA was purified and sequencing libraries were prepared using standard commercial kits.
[0354]
Sequencing libraries were run on an Illumina MiSeq using V2 2x150 kits. The data was filtered and analyzed for valid sites that captured an oligonucleotide and a potential off-target site is predicted. Here again, the protocol needed to be adjusted from the PAM search used for CRISPR-cas9 to the HBV 11-12 meganuclease search. The software developed checks each sequence to make sure there is adapter and captured oligo flanking the sequence to verify that it is a valid read. The software also checks for PCR duplicates and removes reads that are identical to help reduce PCR bias. The sequence reads are aligned to a reference genome and grouped sequences within thousand base pair windows are scanned for a potential HBV 11-12 meganuclease site.
[0355]
Each HBV 11-12 meganuclease is a linked dimer. Each monomer recognizes a nine base pair half site with a four base pair spacer in the center between the two half sites. The software looks for the closest sequence match for each half site with no allowed gaps. The middle four base pairs are not considered in the off-target selection because the HBV 11-12 meganucleases can generally tolerate a higher amount of degeneracy at these positions in the target site. The software outputs a list of potential off-target sites with the number of base mismatches in the combined half sites but not counting the middle four base pair mismatches. The software does not eliminate any off-targets based on an arbitrary mismatch filter, unlike CRISPR-Cas9 which eliminates any off-target identified with more than six base pairs mismatched. Instead, background noise generated from random capture of the oligo at fragile spots or hot spots within the genome can be reduced in two ways. First, an untreated mock sample is also run though oligo capture and windows of integration sites without the nuclease present can be subtracted from the nuclease containing samples. We have also found that running the assay in triplicate and eliminating any sites that do not repeat in at least two of the three repeats is a good way to empirically remove random integration noise.
[0356]
Although read count does not directly correlate with cutting frequency at a particular site, it can generally highlight off-targets that are potentially more concerning or more valid because they occur more often. One way to graphically visualize the oligo capture data as a measure of number of potentially valid off-target sites is shown in FIG. 11. Each off-target generated by a particular nuclease is plotted based on the number of unique sequence reads aligned at that site. The number of base pair mismatches between the putative off-target site and the intended site are indicated by color scale with darker colors indicating sites that are more similar to the intended target site. For a nuclease with high-specificity, the intended site should have the highest read count. Better nucleases remove both the higher count sites (to the right of the graph) and the sites with high similarity (darker colored points).
[0357]
In FIG. 11, which was generated in the HepG2 cell line lacking the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence, each of the optimized meganucleases lacked the higher read count off-targets and reduced the number of high similarity off-targets observed for the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease. The HBV 11-12L.363 and HBV 11-12L.367 meganucleases, exhibited further improvements over the earlier generation HBV 11-12L.118 meganuclease. However, because oligo capture provides a relative activity of a nuclease to target sites within a sample, it is difficult to determine the extent to which these off-targets are cut without an on-target intended site for comparison.
[0358]
In FIG. 12, HBV 11-12x.26 and HBV 11-12L.363 were compared in the HepG2 HepB cell line, which comprises a partial HBV genome including the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence. While the number of reads aligned at the intended site cannot be compared between samples as a measure of total activity at the intended site, the distance between the points indicating the intended site (circled) and the points indicating off-target sites can be compared. The far larger distance between the intended site and the off-target sites for HBV 11-12L.363 than that of HBV 11-12x.26 indicates a large increase in the specificity of the enzyme and a large decrease in cleavage of off-target sites both in number of sites and percentage cleaved.
[0359]
In summary, the optimized meganucleases, and particularly HBV 11-12L.363 and HBV 11-12L.367, showed clear superiority in specificity over the parental HBV 11-12x.26 as determined by oligo capture. All three optimized enzymes showed a significant reduction in both highly similar, less frequently cleaved sites, and less similar, more frequently cut sites. Further analysis of HBV 11-12L.363 demonstrated a large increase in the ratio of cleavage activity at the intended site to cleavage activity at off-target sites compared to HBV 11-12x.26.
Example 2
Generation of Indels at Recognition Sequence In Vitro
[0360]
Studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of HBV 11-12 meganucleases for causing insertions and/or deletions (“indels”) at their intended recognition sequence (i.e., the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence). Indel formation was detected in these experiments by either a T7 endonuclease I (T7E) digest or digital PCR analysis.
[0361]
In these experiments, a HepG2 cell line (HepG2 HepB) was generated by Precision BioSciences to stably express one copy (as determined by digital PCR) of a ˜1500 bp region of the Hepatitis B genome including the HBV 11-12 meganuclease target site. HepG2 HepB (5×105) cells were transfected with mRNA (1 μg) encoding HBV 11-12L.26, HBV 11-12L.188, HBV 11-12L.363, HBV 11-12L.367, and HBV 11-12x.26, respectively, using the ThermoFisher Neon Transfection System according to the manufacturer's protocol. At two days post-transfection, genomic DNA was isolated from cells for analysis of indel formation by T7E and digital PCR. Genomic DNA from mock transfected HepG2 HepB cells was used as a control.
[0362]
For T7E analysis, genomic DNA was PCR amplified using P1 and P2 primers:
P1:
(SEQ ID NO: 25)
[5′-gccatttttcataagtgttaacttccgctcctc-3′]
P2:
(SEQ ID NO: 26)
[5′-cgtgcagtcactatggatcaactacttagatg-3′]
[0363]
Amplification was confirmed by visualization of a ˜1650 bp band on an agarose gel. PCR-amplified DNA was denatured and slowly rehybridized to allow formation of heteroduplex DNA sequences and then digested with T7 endonuclease I. Digestion products were visualized on an agarose gel.
[0364]
While mock-transfected cells yielded a single band at ˜1650 bp, transfection with HBV 11-12L.26, HBV 11-12L.188, HBV 11-12L.363, HBV 11-12L.367 and HBV 11-12x.26, respectively, yielded two lower molecular weight bands at ˜600 bp and ˜1050 bp after T7E digestion, indicating successful gene editing (FIG. 13). Surprisingly, the increased intensity of the lower bands in HBV 11-12L.363 compared to the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 indicates that a higher efficiency of gene editing at the target site was achieved.
[0365]
Digital PCR was performed using the QX200 droplet digital PCR system to quantify indel formation in HepG2 HepB cells after meganuclease transfection. A FAM-tagged TaqMan probe (T1) was designed to recognize the HBV 11-12 meganuclease target site, as well as a HEX-tagged TaqMan probe (T2) that binds genomic sequence ˜100 bp downstream of the target site, intended to serve as a reference probe. The probes were multiplexed for genomic DNA amplification using primers P3 and P4. Droplets were gated by fluorescence amplitude to indicate double-positive, double-negative, and single-positive populations. Indels were calculated as the number of HEX-positive droplets divided by the number of double-positive (FAM+/HEX+) droplets.
P3:
(SEQ ID NO: 27)
[5′-ggtctgtgccaagtgtttg-3′]
P4:
(SEQ ID NO: 28)
[5′-gtagacaaaggacgttccg-3′]
T1:

[5′-tgccgatccatactgcggaact-3′]
T2:
(SEQ ID NO: 30)
[5′-cacagcctagcagccatggaaac-3′]
[0366]
Genomic DNA from cells treated with HBV 11-12 meganucleases showed 11-27% gene editing at the recognition site (FIG. 14). In agreement with the T7E data, genomic DNA from HBV 11-12L.363-treated cells advantageously yielded the highest efficiency of indel formation at 27%, while the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 produced 13% indel formation, suggesting enhanced (i.e., increased) activity of the optimized HBV 11-12L.363 meganuclease.
[0367]
Together, these data indicate an ability of HBV 11-12 meganucleases to achieve 11-27% indel formation at their recognition site. Furthermore, HBV 11-12L.363 shows enhanced (i.e., increased) activity for indel formation compared to the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26 meganuclease.
Example 3
Indel Frequency in HepG2 HepB Cells after Electroporation with HBV 11-12 mRNA
[0368]
Further studies were conducted to evaluate the production of indels in HepG2 HepB cells following transfection with mRNA encoding the HBV 11-12x.26 or HBV 11-12L.363 meganucleases. HepG2 HepB cells described in Example 2 were electroporated with meganuclease-encoding mRNA according to the same protocols as above. In this experiment, two different mRNA batches encoding the HBV 11-12L.363 meganucleases were evaluated. Cells were electroporated with mRNA encoding either HBV 11-12x.26 (3605), a previously prepared batch of mRNA encoding HBV 11-12L.363 (3129), or a new batch of mRNA encoding HBV 11-12L.363 (3606). An mRNA encoding GFP was also electroporated into cells to serve as a transfection control. GFP-transfected cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and transfection efficiency exceeded 90%. Cells were collected at 2 days and 6 days post-transfection, and subjected to gDNA isolation and ddPCR analysis as previously described in Example 2. Indel frequency was determined from ddPCR analysis.
[0369]
Data obtained from ddPCR demonstrated that HBV 11-12L.363, which was optimized from HBV 11-12x.26, shows ˜20% indels 2 days post-transfection, and ˜33% indels at 6 days post-transfection (FIG. 15). Two batches of mRNA encoding HBV 11-12L.363 (3129 and 3606) were tested and showed consistent levels of indel formation. Each of these were superior to the level of indel formation observed using HBV 11-12x.26, which showed ˜10% and 15% indels at 2 days and 6 days post-transfection, respectively.
[0370]
Together these data suggest that the HBV 11-12L.363 nuclease is significantly more active in producing indels at the HBV 11-12 recognition sequence than the previous generation nuclease, HBV 11-12x.26. Furthermore, consistent levels of indels were observed between mRNA batches of HBV 11-12L.363.
Example 4
In Vitro Antiviral Evaluation of HBV 11-12L.363 in HBV-Integrated HepAD38 Cells by mRNA Expression
[0371]
Studies were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of HBV 11-12 meganuclease and efficacy for insertions and/or deletions (“indels”) at their intended recognition sequence in HBV-integrated HepAD38 cells. Antiviral activity, secreted HBs antigen was measured by Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) kit. Indel formation was detected by GeneART Genomic Cleavage Detection kit.
[0372]
In this study, a HepAD38 cell line which expresses wild-type HBV, subtype ayw (Ladner, S K et al. “Inducible expression of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) in stably transfected hepatoblastoma cells: a novel system for screening potential inhibitors of HBV replication.” Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapyvol. 41, 8 (1997): 1715-20.) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium (DMEM/F12; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 500 μg/ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine, 0.3 μg/ml tetracycline, 10 mM HEPES, 1×MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids and 1% Dimethyl sulfoxide at 37° C. and 5% carbon dioxide. HepAD38 (1.5×10{circumflex over ( )}6) cells were transfected with mRNA (3 ug) encoding HBV 11-12L.363, HBV 11-12x.26 and mCherry (TriLink), respectively, by using the Lipofectamine MessengerMAX (Thermo Fisher), TranslT-mRNA (Mirus), and jetMESSENGER (Polyplus) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
[0373]
HepAD38 (1.5×10{circumflex over ( )}6) cells were also transfected with mRNA (3 ug) formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The lipid materials used for the formulation of LNPs consisted of Dlin-MC3-DMA, Cholesterol, DSPC, and DMG-PEG dissolved at a 50:38.5:10:1.5 molar ratio in ethanol at a total lipid concentration of 30 mM (N:P=8). The mix of lipids was stored at −80C and thawed by heating to 50° C. in heat block. Lipid mix was taken off heat and vortexed immediately before use in formulation. mRNA was stored at −80° C. and thawed at room temperature. Once thawed, the mRNA was diluted to 0.2 mg/mL in a 50 mM citrate buffer at pH=4.0. Microfluidic mixing of the mRNA and lipid solutions at a 3:1 ratio via Precision Nanosystems benchtop nanoassembler was performed. Crude solution was transferred to dialysis membrane and placed in 200× volume of PBS, pH=7.4, overnight. Final solution was collected from dialysis membrane and analyzed for physical characteristics such as size, PDI, and zeta potential, as well as for encapsulation efficiency. LNP transfection was performed with or without apolipoprotein E (1 μg/mL).
[0374]
The mRNA materials encoding the HBV 11-12L.363, HBV 11-12x.26 nucleases comprised a clean cap structure (Trilink) with a uridine substitution to N1-methyl-pseudouridine.
[0375]
At day 4 and day 6 post-transfection, supernatant was collected for measuring secreted HBs antigen by CLIA assay (AutoBio). To determine the percentage of HBs antigen reduction, mCherry transfected in HepAD38 cells was used as 100% control.
[0376]
Through mRNA expression, both HBV 11-12L.363 and HBV 11-12x.26 showed similar antiviral activity, reducing ˜50% secreted HBs antigen. Four-day post-transfection had a higher effect than that of six-day post-transfection (FIG. 16).
[0377]
At six-day post-transfection, genomic DNA was isolated from cells for analysis of indel formation by GeneART Genomic Cleavage Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher). Genomic DNA from mCherry transfected in HepAD38 cells was used as a control.
[0378]
For Genomic Cleavage Detection assay, genomic DNA was PCR amplified using AD38-F1012 and AD38-R1479 primers:
AD38-F1012:
(SEQ ID NO: 31)
[5′-GGTTTTGCTGCCCCATTTACA-3′]
AD38-R1479:
(SEQ ID NO: 32)
[5′-TCCCAAGCGACCCCGAGAAG-3′]
[0379]
Amplification was confirmed by the visualization of a ˜467 bp band on an agarose gel. PCR-amplified DNA was analyzed in the cleavage assay according to the manufacture's protocol. Digestion products were visualized on an agarose gel.
[0380]
While mCherry-transfected cells yielded a single band at ˜467 bp, transfected with HBV 11-12L.363 and HBV 11-12x.26, respectively, yielded two lower molecular weight bands at ˜267 bp and ˜200 bp after Detection Enzyme digestion, indicating successful gene editing (FIG. 17). Comparing HBV 11-12L.363 with the first-generation HBV 11-12x.26, the increased intensity of lower bands indicates the higher efficiency of gene editing at the target site was achieved.
[0381]
Overall, HBV 11-12L.363 showed similar antiviral activities as HBV 11-12x.26 in HBV-integrated HepAD38 cells by mRNA expression. Both HBV 11-12 meganuclease were capable of reducing ˜50% HBs antigen secretion and achieving significant indels. Although the antiviral activity observed in these studies is lower than reductions observed in previous lentiviral studies with HBV 11-12x.26, these differences could be attributed to lower delivery efficiency of mRNA transfection vs ˜100% lentiviral transduction, transient mRNA expression having shorter kinetics than persistent lentiviral expression, in addition to suboptimal timing and assay sensitivity for gene editing efficiency assessment.
