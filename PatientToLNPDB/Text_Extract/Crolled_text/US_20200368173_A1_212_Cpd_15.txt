Description
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]
The present invention relates to a nucleic acid-containing lipid nanoparticle.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]
In order to achieve gene therapy, carriers have been developed for efficiently delivering nucleic acids such as plasmid DNA (pDNA), antisense oligodeoxynucleic acid (ODN) and short interfering RNA (siRNA) to target cells in vivo. A method which involves allowing lipid particles to contain nucleic acids in order to protect the nucleic acids from in vivo nucleases and the like, and administering the complexes is known as an approach thereof.
[0003]
Patent Literature 1 and Non Patent Literature 1 have reported, as a method for producing a liposome containing a nucleic acid or the like, for example, a method for producing a liposome containing siRNA by dissolving a dried cationic lipid, an aqueous sodium citrate solution of siRNA and a neutral lipid, and a polyethylene glycolated phospholipid in HEPES [N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-ethanesulfonic acid)] buffered saline (hereinafter, referred to as “HBS”) and ethanol, adding the resulting solution to diethyl ether to form a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion, then mixing the solution, and treating the solution by a reverse-phase evaporation method.
[0004]
Patent Literature 2 and Non Patent Literature 2 have reported a method for producing a liposome containing ODN by dissolving ODN in an aqueous citric acid solution of pH 3.8, adding a solution of a lipid in ethanol to the solution, decreasing the ethanol concentration to 20 v/v % to prepare a liposome containing ODN, filtering the solution through a sizing membrane, removing an excess of ethanol by dialysis, and then further dialyzing the sample at pH 7.5 to remove ODN attached to the liposome surface.
[0005]
Patent Literature 3 has reported, for example, a method for producing a liposome containing pDNA by mixing a solution containing pDNA dissolved in an aqueous citric acid solution with a solution containing a lipid dissolved in ethanol using a T-shaped mixer, decreasing the ethanol concentration to 45 v/v %, then further adding thereto a citrate buffer solution so that the ethanol concentration is decreased to 20 v/v % to prepare a liposome containing pDNA, removing residual pDNA through an anion-exchange resin, and removing an excess of ethanol by ultrafiltration.
[0006]
Patent Literature 4 has reported a method for producing a liposome containing pDNA by complexing pDNA with a cationic lipid as micelle in an organic solvent containing water, further adding a lipid thereto, and then removing the organic solvent by dialysis.
[0007]
Patent Literature 5 has reported a method for producing a liposome containing pDNA by complexing pDNA with a cationic lipid as micelle in an aqueous solution of a surfactant, further adding a lipid thereto, and then removing the surfactant by dialysis.
[0008]
Meanwhile, Non Patent Literature 3 has reported that in a test using lipid nanoparticles containing doxorubicin, the contents are efficiently released by hydrolyzing an ester bond at position sn-2 of phospholipid with phospholipase A2 (hereinafter, also referred to as “PLA2”). This means that when phospholipid, a constituent of the lipid nanoparticles, is metabolized with phospholipase A2 in vivo, the stability of the particles carrying a drug is reduced. When the drug is a low-molecular drug, the reduced stability of the particles facilitates smoothly releasing the drug so that the drug exhibits activity. On the other hand, when the contents are a nucleic acid, the nucleic acid is poorly taken up into cells even after release and is enzymatically degraded, leading to the disappearance of its activity. Nanoparticles containing the nucleic acid mentioned above generally employ a lipid served as a substrate of PLA2. Thus, it has been difficult to prepare a lipid particle having high stability.
[0009]
Patent Literature 6 discloses that 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine is used in a composition for the oral administration and transport of bioactive drugs, and states that such a composition is stable against acids. However, the literature does not state that this composition was used for nucleic acid transport.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0064]
Hereinafter, the mode for carrying out the present invention will be described in detail. The embodiments described below do not limit the present invention.
[0065]
The nucleic acid-containing lipid nanoparticle of the present invention comprises an analog of a fatty acid ester of glycerol, and a nucleic acid. The analog is not hydrolyzable by a lipase.
[0066]
The nucleic acid-containing lipid nanoparticle of the present invention can be stably present even if contacted with a lipase, because the lipid in the particle resists degradation.
[0067]
In a lipid having a fatty acid ester structure of glycerol (hereinafter, also referred to as a natural glycerol lipid), at least one hydroxy group of glycerol, and a fatty acid form an ester bond. This ester bond is hydrolyzed by the action of a lipase.
[0068]
The analog of the fatty acid ester of glycerol according to the present invention is a lipid having a structure modified from a partial structure in the natural glycerol lipid, and is not hydrolyzable by a lipase.
[0069]
In the present invention, the phrase “not hydrolyzable by a lipase” means that when the nucleic acid-containing lipid nanoparticle of the present invention is contacted with a lipase, usually 30% or more, preferably 50% or more, more preferably 70% or more, further preferably 90% or more, still further preferably 99% or more, is not degraded with respect to the total amount of the analog of the fatty acid ester of glycerol present in the nucleic acid-containing lipid nanoparticle.
[0070]
The bringing into contact the analog with the lipase is performed under conditions of usually 30 to 45° C., preferably 35 to 42° C., more preferably 37° C., and usually 0 minutes to 48 hours, preferably 1 minute to 36 hours, more preferably 1 minute to 24 hours.
[0071]
The analog of the fatty acid ester of glycerol according to the present invention is preferably structurally modified in the range of preferably 10 angstroms (angstrom: 10−10 m) or less, more preferably 8 angstroms or less, further preferably 6 angstroms or less, from the carbon atom at position sn-2 of a glycerol skeleton in a natural glycerol lipid represented by formula (NL1) given below. When the structural modification is in the range of 10 angstroms or less from the carbon atom at position sn-2, the nucleic acid-containing lipid nanoparticle tends to resist the hydrolytic effect of a lipase and is thus stabilized.
[0072]
The lower limit value of the structural modification range is not particularly limited as long as the lower limit value is 0 angstroms or more. The range of 0 angstroms from the carbon atom at position sn-2 refers to the carbon atom at position sn-2.
[0073]
In this context, the structural modification means that a structure near the glycerol skeleton of the natural glycerol lipid is changed, and is not particularly limited as long as the structural modification reduces interaction with an active site of a lipase. Examples thereof include: the inversion of the asymmetric center of the natural glycerol lipid, i.e., the conversion of an L form to a D form; the replacement of the ester bond between the glycerol skeleton and the fatty acid with a bond such as an ether bond (—O—), a thioether bond (—S—), an amino bond (—N(Rp)— (wherein Rp is a hydrogen atom or an organic group) or an amide bond (—NHCO—); the replacement of hydrogen at any one or more of positions sn-1, sn-2 and sn-3 with an organic group; and the introduction of an organic group to position α, β, γ or δ of an acyl group mentioned later.
[0074]
Examples of the organic group include hydroxy, alkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, nitro, cyano, fluoro, chloro and bromo.

[0123]
In the present invention, the lipid having a hydrophilic unit having one quaternary ammonium group and optionally substituted three independent hydrocarbon groups (lipid A) is not particularly limited as long as the lipid is a molecule intramolecularly having one quaternary ammonium group as a hydrophilic unit and having optionally substituted three independent hydrocarbon groups. Lipid A is represented by, for example, any of structural formulas (A) to (C) given below.

Examples thereof include linear hydrocarbon groups, branched hydrocarbon groups and cyclic hydrocarbon groups (e.g., a cholesteryl group). A linear or branched hydrocarbon group is preferred. Also, hydrocarbon groups can be classified on the basis of the presence or absence of an unsaturated bond (double bond or triple bond). Hydrocarbon groups having an unsaturated bond can also be classified on the basis of the presence or absence of aromaticity. A hydrocarbon group having only a saturated bond (alkyl) or a hydrocarbon group having an unsaturated bond and lacking aromaticity (e.g., alkenyl or alkynyl) is preferred. The hydrocarbon group in lipid A is preferably linear or branched C8-C24 alkyl, C8-C24 alkenyl or C8-C24 alkynyl.

The double-stranded nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid having a duplex formation moiety composed of paired two strands. The duplex formation moiety refers to a part in which nucleotides constituting the double-stranded nucleic acid, or derivatives thereof have formed a duplex by constituting base pairs. The base pairs constituting the duplex formation moiety are usually 15 to 27 base pairs, preferably 15 to 25 base pairs, more preferably 15 to 23 base pairs, further preferably 15 to 21 base pairs, particularly preferably 15 to 19 base pairs.

For example, a double-stranded nucleic acid having an overhang consisting of 1 to 4 bases, usually 1 to 3 bases, at the 3′ end or the 5′ end of at least one of the strands is used as the double-stranded nucleic acid having the overhang.

In Vitro Activity Evaluation Test of Nucleic Acid-Containing Lipid Nanoparticle
[1706]
Preparations 1 to 9 described in Examples 1 to 9 and preparations 10 to 12 described in Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were each introduced to human pancreatic cancer-derived cell line Mia PaCa-2/Luc cells by the following method.
[1707]
Each preparation was treated with PLA2 and evaluated for its gene suppression ratio according to the method described in [Non Patent Literature 3]. Mia PaCa-2/Luc cells suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) were seeded in a 96-well culture plate at 7500 cells/80 μL/well, and cultured at 37° C. for 24 hours under 5% CO2 conditions. Each preparation diluted with Opti-MEM (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) so as to have a final nucleic acid concentration from 3 to 100 nM was dispensed to the 96-well culture plate at 20 μL/well, and the cells were cultured at 37° C. under 5% CO2 conditions to introduce each preparation into the Mia PaCa-2/Luc cells. Untreated cells were seeded as a negative control group.
[1708]
The cells containing each preparation thus introduced were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator of 37° C. for 24 hours and treated using a luciferase quantification system (Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System, Promega Corp., E2520) in accordance with the method described in the instructions attached to the product, followed by the measurement of luminescence intensity with a plate reader. The amount of luminescence of the group treated with each preparation was calculated as a relative ratio to the corrected amount of luminescence of the negative control group defined as 1 to obtain an IC50 value.
[1709]
As is evident from Table 33, the Luc suppression ratios of preparations 1 to 9 containing D-DPPC, introduced in the human pancreatic cancer-derived cell line MIA PaCa-2/Luc cells, were consequently higher than those of preparations 10 to 12 containing L-DPPC instead of D-DPPC. When preparations 1 to 3 were compared, a higher content of D-DPPC resulted in a higher suppression ratio. Similar results were also obtained about preparations 4 to 6 and 7 to 9.
[1710]
These results demonstrated that the lipid nanoparticle of the present invention containing an analog of a fatty acid ester of glycerol that is not hydrolyzable by a lipase can introduce a nucleic acid into cells, etc. even in the presence of PLA2.

Each preparation diluted with Opti-MEM (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) so as to have a final nucleic acid concentration from 3 to 100 nM was dispensed to the 96-well culture plate at 20 μL/well, and the cells were cultured at 37° C. under 5% CO2 conditions to introduce each preparation into the Mia PaCa-2/Luc cells.

The amount of luminescence of the group treated with each preparation was calculated as a relative ratio to the corrected amount of luminescence of the negative control group defined as 1 to obtain an IC50 value.
[1742]
As is evident from Table 35, the Luc suppression ratios of preparations 13 to 20 containing DL-DSPC, introduced in the human pancreatic cancer-derived cell line MIA PaCa-2/Luc cells, were consequently higher than those of preparations 21 to 24 containing L-DSPC instead of DL-DSPC.

[1802]
Preparations 37 to 44 described in Examples 26 to 33 and preparations 21 to 24 described in Comparative Examples 4 to 7 were each introduced to human pancreatic cancer-derived cell line Mia PaCa-2/Luc cells by the following method.
[1803]
Each preparation was treated with PLA2 and evaluated for its gene suppression ratio according to the method described in [Non Patent Literature 3]. Mia PaCa-2/Luc cells suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) were seeded in a 96-well culture plate at 7500 cells/80 μL/well, and cultured at 37° C. for 24 hours under 5% CO2 conditions. Each preparation diluted with Opti-MEM (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) so as to have a final nucleic acid concentration from 3 to 100 nM was dispensed to the 96-well culture plate at 20 μL/well, and the cells were cultured at 37° C. under 5% CO2 conditions to introduce each preparation into the Mia PaCa-2/Luc cells. Untreated cells were seeded as a negative control group.
[1804]
The cells containing each preparation thus introduced were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator of 37° C. for 24 hours and treated using a luciferase quantification system (Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System, Promega Corp., E2520) in accordance with the method described in the instructions attached to the product, followed by the measurement of luminescence intensity with a plate reader. The amount of luminescence of the group treated with each preparation was calculated as a relative ratio to the corrected amount of luminescence of the negative control group defined as 1 to obtain an IC50 value.
[1805]
As is evident from Table 39, the Luc suppression ratios of preparations 37 to 44 containing Diether-PC, introduced in the human pancreatic cancer-derived cell line MIA PaCa-2/Luc cells, were consequently higher than those of preparations 21 to 24 containing L-DSPC instead of Diether-PC.
