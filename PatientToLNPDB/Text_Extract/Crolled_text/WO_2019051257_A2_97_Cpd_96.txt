METHODS FOR TREATING HEPATITIS B INFECTIONS
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
This patent application claims the benefit of priority of U. S. Application Serial No. 62/556,870 filed September 11, 2017, which application is herein incorporated by reference.
BACKGROUND
Hepatitis B virus (abbreviated as "HBV") is a member of the Hepadnavirus family. The virus particle (sometimes referred to as a virion) includes an outer lipid envelope and an icosahedral nucleocapsid core composed of protein. The nucleocapsid encloses the viral DNA and a DNA polymerase that has reverse transcriptase activity. The outer envelope contains embedded proteins that are involved in viral binding of, and entry into, susceptible cells, typically liver hepatocytes. In addition to the infectious viral particles, filamentous and spherical bodies lacking a core can be found in the serum of infected individuals. These particles are not infectious and are composed of the lipid and protein that forms part of the surface of the virion, which is called the surface antigen (HBsAg), and is produced in excess during the life cycle of the virus.
The genome of HBV is made of circular DNA, but it is unusual because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand is linked to the viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020-3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700-2800 nucleotides long (for the shorter strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. The DNA polymerase is encoded by gene P. Gene S is the gene that codes for the surface antigen (HBsAg). The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame "start" (ATG) codons that divide the gene into three sections, pre-S l, pre-S2, and S. Because of the multiple start codons, polypeptides of three different sizes called large, middle, and small are produced. The function of the protein coded for by gene X is not fully understood but it is associated with the development of liver cancer. Replication of
HBV is a complex process. Although replication takes place in the liver, the virus spreads to the blood where viral proteins and antibodies against them are found in infected people. The structure, replication and biology of HBV is reviewed in D. Glebe and C.M.Bremer, Seminars in Liver Disease, Vol. 33, No. 2, pages 103-112 (2013).
Infection of humans with HBV can cause an infectious inflammatory illness of the liver. Infected individuals may not exhibit symptoms for many years. It is estimated that about a third of the world population has been infected at one point in their lives, including 350 million who are chronic carriers. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Perinatal infection can also be a major route of infection. The acute illness causes liver inflammation, vomiting, jaundice, and possibly death. Chronic hepatitis B may eventually cause cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Although most people who are infected with HBV clear the infection through the action of their immune system, some infected people suffer an aggressive course of infection
(fulminant hepatitis); while others are chronically infected thereby increasing their chance of liver disease. Several medications are currently approved for treatment of HBV infection, but infected individuals respond with various degrees of success to these medications. Over the past few decades, several host and viral factors have been found to be associated with differences in HBV clearance or persistence. However, an unexplained variability in treatment outcome still exists, suggesting that the genetic background of the host plays an important role.
Thus, there is a need to identify new biomarkers that can be used to assess the likelihood that an HBV infected patient will respond positively to a particular treatment regimen.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
As described herein, a series of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified as biomarkers that may be used to detect patients infected with HBV that have a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor. These SNPs are located near the inter leukin 28B (IL-28B) and the inter leukin 28 A (IL-28A) genes on chromosome 19 (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Entrez Gene Entry for IL28B, Gene ID:
282617; Entrez Gene Entry for IL28A, Gene ID: 282616). IL28B encodes ΙΚΝ-λ3, which induces antiviral activity by itself and through the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) complex, which induces IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).
IL28A encodes IFN-X2. In certain embodiments, there is a correlation between such SNPs associated with these genes and with increased IFN- 2 and/or IFN- 3 expression. The table shown below includes a non-limiting list of these IL28A/B SNPs, which may be used in methods of the invention described herein.
* combination of: rsl2979860CT/rs8099917TG; or rsl297980CT/rs809917TT. + indicates that these SNPs have been reported to be in high linkage disequilibrium with rsl2979860. Λ rs368234815 is located upstream of IFNL3/IL28B; a frameshift variant gives rise to IFNL4. See, e.g., Tanaka et al, Nat Genet 2009, 41 : 1 105-1 109; Fischer et al., Hepatol. 2012,
55(6): 1700-10; Aziz et al., Int J Infect Dis 2015, 30:91 -7; Shaikh et al., J Med Virol, 2015, 87(5):814-20; Karatayli et al., Liver Int. 2015, 35(3):846-53; Juniastuti et al., J Clin Microbiol 2014, 52(6): 2193-2195; Prokunina-Olsson et al., Nat Gen 2013, 45(2): 164-71.
Accordingly, certain embodiments of the invention provide a method of identifying a patient that has a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor comprising detecting the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patient's genotype at any one or a combination of the SNPs listed in the table above, wherein a patient having the relevant genotype or combination of genotypes has a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor as compared to an HBV infected patient having different genotypes at these locations. In certain embodiments, at least one SNP from the above table is detected. In certain embodiments, a combination of at least 2 SNPs from the above table are detected. In certain embodiments, a combination of at least 3 SNPs from the above table are detected. In certain embodiments, a combination of at least 4 SNPs from the above table are detected. In certain embodiments, a combination of at least 5 SNPs from the above table are detected.
In certain embodiments of the invention, a patient' s genotype at the rsl2979860 SNP is detected. The rsl2979860 SNP is located approximately 3 kb upstream of the IL-28B gene {see, e.g., Ge et al, Nature 2009, 461 :399-401). As described in the Examples, it has been advantageously shown that individuals having a C/C genotype at rsl2979860 have a higher likelihood of positively responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor treatment than individuals having another genotype at this location. Additionally, patients having a combination of a CT genotype at rsl2979860 and a TG or TT genotype at rs8099917 may also have a higher likelihood of positively responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor treatment.
In certain embodiments of the invention, a patient' s genotype at the rs8099917 SNP is detected. The rs8099917 SNP is located in an intergenic region between IL28A and IL28B, ~8kb downstream from IL28B and ~16kb upstream from IL28A {see, e.g., Suppiah et al., Nat Genet 2009, 41 : 1 100-1 104; Tanaka et al., Nat Genet 2009, 41 : 1 105-1109). In certain embodiments, a T/T genotype at rs8099917 is indicative of a HBV infected patient that has a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor, as compared to an HBV infected patient having a different genotype at this location. Additionally, in certain embodiments, a patient having combination of a T/G genotype at rs8099917 and C/T genotype at rsl2979860 may also have a higher likelihood of positively responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor treatment.
In certain embodiments of the invention, a patient's genotype at the rsl2980275 SNP is detected. rsl2980275 is also located near the IL28B gene {see, e.g., Tanaka et al., Nat Genet
2009, 41 : 1105-1109). In certain embodiments, an A/A genotype at rsl2980275 is indicative of a HBV infected patient that has a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor, as compared to an HBV infected patient having a different genotype at this location.
Thus, certain embodiments of the invention provide a method of identifying a patient that has a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor comprising detecting the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patient's genotype at rsl2079860, rs8099917 and/or rsl2980275, wherein a C/X genotype at rsl2079860, a T/Z genotype at rs8099917 and/or an A/A genotype at rsl2980275 is indicative of a patient that has a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor as compared to an HBV infected patient having different genotypes at rsl2079860, rs8099917 and/or rsl2980275, wherein X is C or T; and Z is T or G. In certain embodiments, X is C. In certain embodiments, Z is T. In certain embodiments, X is T and Z is G. In certain embodiments, X is T and Z is T. In certain embodiments, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patient's genotype at rsl2079860 is detected. In certain embodiments, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patient's genotype at rs8099917 is detected. In certain embodiments, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patient's genotype at rsl2980275 is detected.
Certain embodiments of the invention provide a method of identifying a patient that has a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor comprising detecting the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patient's genotype at rsl2079860, wherein a C/C genotype at rsl2079860 is indicative of a patient that has a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor as compared to an HBV infected patient having a different genotype at rsl2079860.

In certain embodiments of the invention, a method described herein further comprises obtaining a biological sample from the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patient.
Thus, certain embodiments of the invention provide a method of identifying a patient that has a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor comprising:
a) obtaining a biological sample from the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patient; and b) analyzing the sample to detect the patient's genotype at rs 12079860; and

In certain embodiments, a method described herein further comprises administering an effective amount of an HBV antigen inhibitor to the HBV infected patient having a C/C genotype at rsl2079860.
In certain embodiments, an effective amount of an HBV antigen inhibitor for a patient having a C/C genotype at rsl2079860 is less than an effective amount of an HBV antigen inhibitor for a patient having a different genotype at rsl2079860. Thus, in certain embodiments, an HBV infected patient having a C/C genotype at rsl2079860 is administered a different HBV antigen inhibitor treatment regimen than an HBV infected patient having a different genotype at rsl2079860. In certain embodiments, the HBV infected patient having a C/C genotype at rsl2079860 is administered a lower dosage of the HBV antigen inhibitor and/or is administered the HBV antigen inhibitor for a shorter period of time as compared to an HBV infected patient having a different genotype at rsl2079860.

HBV Antigen Inhibitors
The term "HBV antigen inhibitor" refers to a compound that can inhibit the expression and/or function of an HBV antigen {i.e., core or surface antigen), either directly or indirectly. The inhibitor may be of natural or synthetic origin. For example, HBV antigen inhibitors, include but are not limited to, e.g., oligonucleotides, small molecules and polypeptides. The term "small molecule" includes organic molecules having a molecular weight of less than about, e.g., 1000 amu. In one embodiment a small molecule can have a molecular weight of less than about 800 amu. In another embodiment a small molecule can have a molecular weight of less than about 500 amu. In certain embodiments, the HBV inhibitor does not comprise interferon (TFN). In certain embodiments, the HBV antigen inhibitor is a core antigen inhibitor. As used herein, the term "core antigen inhibitor" refers to a compound that can inhibit the expression and/or function of an HBV core antigen.
For example, in certain embodiments, the HBV core antigen inhibitor is a capsid inhibitor. As described herein the term "capsid inhibitor" includes compounds that are capable of inhibiting the expression and/or function of a capsid protein either directly or indirectly. For example, a capsid inhibitor may include, but is not limited to, any compound that inhibits capsid assembly, induces formation of non-capsid polymers, promotes excess capsid assembly or misdirected capsid assembly, affects capsid stabilization, and/or inhibits encapsidation of RNA. Capsid inhibitors also include any compound that inhibits capsid function in a downstream event(s) within the replication process (e.g., viral DNA synthesis, transport of relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) into the nucleus, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) formation, virus maturation, budding and/or release, and the like). For example, in certain embodiments, the inhibitor detectably inhibits the expression level or biological activity of the capsid protein as measured, e.g., using an assay described herein. In certain embodiments, the inhibitor inhibits the level of rcDNA and downstream products of viral life cycle by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 99%.
The term capsid inhibitor includes compounds described in International Patent Applications Publication Numbers WO2013006394, WO2014106019, and WO2014089296, including the following compounds:
The term capsid inhibitor also includes the compounds Bay-41-4109 (see International Patent Application Publication Number WO/2013/144129), AT-61 (see International Patent Application Publication Number WO/1998/33501 ; and King, RW, et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother., 1998, 42, 12, 3179-3186), DVR-01 and DVR-23 (see International Patent Application Publication Number WO 2013/006394; and Campagna, MR, et al., J. of Virology, 2013, 87, 12, 6931, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof:
DVR-01
The term capsid inhibitor also includes the compounds Compound 3, GLS-4, and NVR
3-778.
In certain embodiments, the HBV antigen inhibitor is a surface antigen inhibitor (sAg inhibitor). As described herein the term "surface antigen inhibitor" includes compounds that are capable of inhibiting the expression and/or function of a surface antigen either directly or indirectly.
For example, in certain embodiments, the surface antigen inhibitor is a sAg secretion inhibitor. As described herein the term "sAg secretion inhibitor" includes compounds that are capable of inhibiting, either directly or indirectly, the secretion of sAg (S, M and/or L surface antigens) bearing subviral particles and/or DNA containing viral particles from HBV-infected cells. For example, in certain embodiments, the inhibitor detectably inhibits the secretion of sAg as measured, e.g., using assays known in the art or described herein, e.g., ELISA assay or by Western Blot. In certain embodiments, the inhibitor inhibits the secretion of sAg by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 50%, at least 75%, or at least 90%.

In certain embodiments, the HBV antigen inhibitor is an anti-HBsAg antibody, e.g., mAbs. Certain aspects of the invention are directed to the use of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG).
In certain embodiments, the HBV antigen inhibitor is an oligonucleotide. Oligomeric nucleotides can be designed to target one or more genes and/or transcripts of the HBV genome, thereby inhibiting HBV antigen either directly or indirectly. The term "oligonucleotide" or "oligomeric nucleotide" refers to a polymer or oligomer of nucleotide or nucleoside monomers consisting of naturally- or non-naturally occurring bases, sugars and intersugar (backbone) linkages.
In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide is an antisense molecule. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide is a small interfering RNA (siRNA), Dicer-substrate dsRNA, small hairpin RNA (shRNA), asymmetrical interfering RNA (aiRNA) or microRNA (miRNA).
In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide is a siRNA molecule. The term "small- interfering RNA" or "siRNA" as used herein refers to double stranded RNA (i.e., duplex RNA) that is capable of reducing or inhibiting the expression of a target gene or sequence (e.g., by mediating the degradation or inhibiting the translation of mRNAs which are complementary to the siRNA sequence) when the siRNA is in the same cell as the target gene or sequence. The siRNA may have substantial or complete identity to the target gene or sequence, or may comprise a region of mismatch (i.e., a mismatch motif). In certain embodiments, the siRNAs may be about 19-25 (duplex) nucleotides in length, and is preferably about 20-24, 21-22, or 21- 23 (duplex) nucleotides in length. siRNA duplexes may comprise 3 ' overhangs of about 1 to about 4 nucleotides or about 2 to about 3 nucleotides and 5' phosphate termini. Examples of siRNA include, without limitation, a double-stranded polynucleotide molecule assembled from two separate stranded molecules, wherein one strand is the sense strand and the other is the complementary antisense strand.
Preferably, siRNA are chemically synthesized. siRNA can also be generated by cleavage of longer dsRNA (e.g., dsRNA greater than about 25 nucleotides in length) with the E. coli RNase III or Dicer. These enzymes process the dsRNA into biologically active siRNA (see, e.g., Yang et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 99:9942-9947 (2002); Calegari et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 99: 14236 (2002); Byrom et al, Ambion TechNotes, 10(1) 4-6 (2003); Kawasaki et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 31 :981-987 (2003); Knight et al , Science, 293 :2269-2271 (2001); and Robertson et al, J. Biol. Chem., 243 :82 (1968)). Preferably, dsRNA are at least 50 nucleotides to about 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 nucleotides in length. A dsRNA may be as long as 1000, 1500, 2000, 5000 nucleotides in length, or longer. The dsRNA can encode for an entire gene transcript or a partial gene transcript. In certain instances, siRNA may be encoded by a plasmid {e.g. , transcribed as sequences that automatically fold into duplexes with hairpin loops).
In certain embodiments, the siRNA may comprise one or more modified ribonucleotides and/or one or more backbone modifications (e.g., one or more ribonucleotides with a 2 -0- methyl modification, one or more UNA moieties, one or more 2'-Fluoro nucleotides, and/or one or more phosphorothioate linkers).
In certain embodiments, the 5' and/or 3' overhang on one or both strands of the siRNA comprises 1-4 {e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4) modified and/or unmodified deoxythymidine (t or dT) nucleotides, 1-4 {e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4) modified {e.g., 2'OMe) and/or unmodified uridine (U) ribonucleotides, and/or 1-4 {e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4) modified {e.g., 2'OMe) and/or unmodified ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides having complementarity to the target sequence (e.g., 3'overhang in the antisense strand) or the complementary strand thereof (e.g., 3' overhang in the sense strand).
In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide is an isolated, double stranded, siRNA molecule, that includes a sense strand and an antisense strand that is hybridized to the sense strand. The siRNA target one or more genes and/or transcripts of the HBV genome. In certain embodiments, the HBV inhibitor may be a composition comprising a combination {e.g., a cocktail, pool, or mixture) of siRNAs that target different regions of the HBV genome, and thereby inhibit HBV antigen.
Examples of such siRNA molecules are the siRNA molecules set forth in Tables A and B. Thus, in certain embodiments, the HBV antigen inhibitor is an siRNA molecule selected from the siRNA molecules described in Tables A and B.
These sense and antisense strands, shown in Tables A and B, are useful, for example, for making siRNA molecules that are useful to reduce the expression of one or more HBV genes in vivo or in vitro. These sense and antisense strands are also useful, for example, as hybridization probes for identifying and measuring the amount of HBV genome in a biological material, such as a tissue or blood sample from a human being infected with HBV or HBV/HDV. In particular embodiments, an oligonucleotide (such as the sense and antisense RNA strands set forth in Tables A and B) of the invention specifically hybridizes to or is
complementary to a target polynucleotide sequence. The terms "specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" as used herein indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between the DNA or RNA target and the oligonucleotide. It is understood that an oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to its target nucleic acid sequence to be specifically hybridizable. In preferred embodiments, an oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when binding of the oligonucleotide to the target sequence interferes with the normal function of the target sequence to cause a loss of utility or expression therefrom, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, or, in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are conducted. Thus, the oligonucleotide may include 1, 2, 3, or more base substitutions as compared to the region of a gene or mRNA sequence that it is targeting or to which it specifically hybridizes.
In certain embodiments, the HBV antigen inhibitor comprises a combination of two or more different siRNA molecules (e.g., a cocktail) selected from the siRNA molecules described in Tables A and B. In certain embodiments, the HBV antigen inhibitor comprises a combination of three or more different siRNA molecules selected from the siRNA molecules described in Tables A and B. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides compositions {e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) that include one of the two way or three way combinations of the siRNAs set forth in Tables A and B (see, e.g., Examples 26 and 27). In one aspect, the present invention provides combinations of two or three siRNA molecules, such as the combinations disclosed in the Examples, and compositions comprising such combinations, and uses of such combinations.
In certain embodiments, the HBV antigen inhibitor is a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more {e.g., a cocktail) of the siRNAs described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Table A.

Certain embodiments of the invention are directed to the use of agents that are HBV entry inhibitors. Entry inhibitors include Myrcludex-B, NTCP inhibitor small molecules, and FXR agonist EYP001 (see, e.g., Gripon, P., Cannie, I. and Urban, S. Efficient Inhibition of Hepatitis B Virus Infection by Acylated Peptides Derived from the Large Viral Surface Protein. Journal of Virology, 79(3): 1613-1622; Volz, T., Allweiss, L., MBarek, M, Warlich, M., Lohse, A., Pollok, J., Alexandrov, A., Urban, S., Petersen, J., Lutgehetmann, M., Dandri, M. The entry inhibitor Myrcludex-B efficiently blocks intrahepatic virus spreading in humanized mice previously infected with hepatitis B virus. Journal of Hepatology, 58(5): 861-867; Radreau, P., Procherot, M., Vonderscher, J., Lotteau, V., Andre, P. Effect of a novel synthetic FXR agonist EYP001 on hepatitis B virus replication in HepaRG cell line and primary human hepatocytes. AASLD LiverLeaming, Abstract 1652, November 16, 2015; WO 2015/036442; WO 00/37077; US2007/0015796). For example, the hepatitis B virus uses its surface lipopeptide pre-Sl for docking to mature liver cells via their sodium/bile acid cotransporter (NTCP) and subsequently entering the cells. Myrcludex B is a synthetic N-acylated pre-S l that can also dock to NTCP, blocking the virus's entry mechanism.

Certain Definitions
As used herein, the following terms have the meanings ascribed to them unless specified otherwise.
The term "Hepatitis B virus" (abbreviated as HBV) refers to a virus species of the genus
Orthohepadnavirus, which is a part of the Hepadnaviridae family of viruses, and that is capable of causing liver inflammation in humans.
The term "Hepatitis D virus" (abbreviated as HDV) refers to a virus species of the genus Deltaviridae, which is capable of causing liver inflammation in humans. HDV is a small circular enveloped RNA virus that can propagate only in the presence HBV. In particular, HDV requires the HBV surface antigen protein to propagate itself. Infection with both HBV and HDV results in more severe complications compared to infection with HBV alone. These
complications include a greater likelihood of experiencing liver failure in acute infections and a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, with an increased chance of developing liver cancer in chronic infections. In combination with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis D has the highest mortality rate of all the hepatitis infections. The routes of transmission of HDV are similar to those for HBV.
A "gene," for the purposes of the present disclosure, includes a DNA region encoding a gene product, as well as all DNA regions which regulate the production of the gene product, whether or not such regulatory sequences are adjacent to coding and/or transcribed sequences. The term "gene" is used broadly to refer to any segment of nucleic acid associated with a biological function. Genes include coding sequences and/or the regulatory sequences required for their expression. Accordingly, a gene includes, but is not necessarily limited to, promoter sequences, terminators, translational regulatory sequences such as ribosome binding sites and internal ribosome entry sites, enhancers, silencers, insulators, boundary elements, replication origins, matrix attachment sites and locus control regions. For example, "gene" refers to a nucleic acid fragment that expresses mRNA, functional RNA, or specific protein, including regulatory sequences. "Functional RNA" refers to sense RNA, antisense RNA, ribozyme RNA, siRNA, or other RNA that may not be translated but yet has an effect on at least one cellular process. "Genes" also include nonexpressed DNA segments that, for example, form recognition sequences for other proteins. "Genes" can be obtained from a variety of sources, including cloning from a source of interest or synthesizing from known or predicted sequence information, and may include sequences designed to have desired parameters. The term "endogenous gene" refers to a native gene in its natural location in the genome of an organism.
The term "single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)" refers to a DNA sequence variation that occurs when a single nucleotide in the genome differs between members of a species or paired chromosomes in an individual. As used herein, references to SNPs and SNP genotypes include individual SNPs and/or haplotypes, which are groups of SNPs that are generally inherited together. The disclosure of U. S. Pat. No. 7,820,380, which is incorporated by reference, provides a detailed discussion on a variety of methods that employ SNP genotyping. For example, it is disclosed that various methods for detecting polymorphisms include, but are not limited to, sequencing, methods in which protection from cleavage agents is used to detect mismatched bases in RNA/RNA or RNA/DNA duplexes (Myers et al., Science 230: 1242 (1985); Cotton et al., PNAS 85 :4397 (1988); and Saleeba et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:286-295 (1992)), comparison of the electrophoretic mobility of variant and wild type nucleic acid molecules (Orita et al, PNAS 86:2766 (1989); Cotton et al., Mutat. Res. 285 : 125-144 (1993); and Hayashi et al., Genet. Anal. Tech. App 9:73-79 (1992)), and assaying the movement of polymorphic or wild type fragments in polyacrylamide gels containing a gradient of denaturant using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Myers et al., Nature 313 :495 (1985)).
Sequence variations at specific locations can also be assessed by nuclease protection assays such as RNase and 51 protection or chemical cleavage methods. In certain embodiments, sequence variations may be detected using a real-time PCR assay (e.g., employing a fluorescent probe). US. Pat. No. 7,820,380 also discloses that SNP genotyping can include the steps of, for example, collecting a biological sample from a human subject (e.g., sample of tissues, cells, fluids, secretions, etc.), isolating nucleic acids (e.g., genomic DNA, mRNA or both) from the cells of the sample, contacting the nucleic acids with one or more primers which specifically hybridize to a region of the isolated nucleic acid containing a target SNP under conditions such that hybridization and amplification of the target nucleic acid region occurs, and determining the nucleotide present at the SNP position of interest, or, in some assays, detecting the presence or absence of an amplification product (assays can be designed so that hybridization and/or amplification will only occur if a particular SNP allele is present or absent).
The term "detecting" is used in the broadest sense to include both qualitative and quantitative measurements of a specific molecule, for example, measurements of a specific molecule such as a chromosome, a DNA sequence, individual nucleic acids, etc.
The term "obtaining a biological sample from a hepatitis B patient" is used to refer to obtaining the sample directly from the patient, as well as obtaining the sample indirectly from an intermediary individual (e.g., obtaining the sample from a courier who obtained the sample from a nurse who obtained the sample from the patient).
The term "biological sample" refers to a body sample from any animal, but preferably is from a mammal, more preferably from a human. Such samples include biological fluids such as serum, plasma, vitreous fluid, lymph fluid, synovial fluid, follicular fluid, seminal fluid, amniotic fluid, whole blood, biopsy material, urine, cerebro-spinal fluid, saliva, sputum, tears, perspiration, and mucus. The term also refers to tissue extracts, such as homogenized tissue and cellular extracts, and cellular samples (e.g., oral epithelial cells).
The terms "a higher likelihood of responding to an HBV antigen inhibitor" refers to the likelihood of a patient having a favorable response to the HBV antigen inhibitor. Favorable responses include, but are not limited to, preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In certain embodiments, a favorable response is a reduction in HBV DNA or RNA (e.g., by about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 709%, 80%, 90% or more; or e.g., is undetectable after e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months, etc. after cessation of HBV therapy). In certain embodiments, a favorable response is sustained virological response (SVR). In certain embodiments, a favorable response is a reduction in HBV core protein (e.g., by about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 709%, 80%, 90% or more). In certain
embodiments, a favorable response is a reduction in surface antigen (e.g., by about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 709%, 80%, 90% or more). In certain embodiments, a favorable response is seroconversion (e.g., HBsAg seroconversion). For example, in certain embodiments, patients that have a C/C genotype at rsl2079860 may have a faster rate of surface antigen decline in response to the administration of an HBV antigen inhibitor as compared to a patient having a different genotype. In certain embodiments, patients that have a C/C genotype at rsl2079860 may have greater decline in surface antigen in response to the administration of an HBV antigen inhibitor as compared to a patient having a different genotype. In certain embodiments, patients that have a C/C genotype at rsl2079860 may have a higher likelihood of seroconverting in response to an HBV inhibitor as compared to a patient having a different genotype. Methods of measuring a response to an HBV antigen inhibitor are known in the art, for example, an assay described in Example 27 may be used.
As used herein, "treatment" (and grammatical variations thereof such as "treat" or "treating") refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the typical disease course of the individual being treated. Desirable effects of treatment include, but are not limited to, preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, treatments described herein are used to delay development of a disease or to slow the progression of a disease.
The term "patient" as used herein refers to any animal including mammals such as humans, higher non-human primates, rodents domestic and farm animals such as cow, horses, dogs and cats. In one embodiment, the patient is a human patient.
The phrase "effective amount" means an amount of a compound described herein that (i) treats or prevents a hepatitis B virus infection, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of a hepatitis B virus infection, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of a hepatitis B virus infection.
The phrase "inhibiting expression of a target gene" refers to the ability of a siRNA described herein to silence, reduce, or inhibit expression of a target gene (e.g., a gene within the HBV genome). To examine the extent of gene silencing, a test sample (e.g., a biological sample from an organism of interest expressing the target gene or a sample of cells in culture expressing the target gene) is contacted with a siRNA that silences, reduces, or inhibits expression of the target gene. Expression of the target gene in the test sample is compared to expression of the target gene in a control sample (e.g., a biological sample from an organism of interest expressing the target gene or a sample of cells in culture expressing the target gene) that is not contacted with the siRNA. Control samples (e.g. , samples expressing the target gene) may be assigned a value of 100%. In particular embodiments, silencing, inhibition, or reduction of expression of a target gene is achieved when the value of the test sample relative to the control sample (e.g., buffer only, an siRNA sequence that targets a different gene, a scrambled siRNA sequence, etc.) is about 100%, 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 94%, 93%, 92%, 91%, 90%, 89%, 88%, 87%, 86%, 85%, 84%, 83%, 82%, 81%, 80%, 79%, 78%, 77%, 76%, 75%, 70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 0%. Suitable assays include, without limitation, examination of protein or mRNA levels using techniques known to those of skill in the art, such as, e.g., dot blots, Northern blots, in situ hybridization, ELISA,
immunoprecipitation, enzyme function, as well as phenotypic assays known to those of skill in the art. An "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" of a therapeutic nucleic acid such as a siRNA is an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect, e.g., an inhibition of expression of a target sequence in comparison to the normal expression level detected in the absence of a siRNA. In particular embodiments, inhibition of expression of a target gene or target sequence is achieved when the value obtained with a siRNA relative to the control {e.g., buffer only, an siRNA sequence that targets a different gene, a scrambled siRNA sequence, etc.) is about 100%, 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 94%, 93%, 92%, 91%, 90%, 89%, 88%, 87%, 86%, 85%, 84%, 83%, 82%, 81%, 80%, 79%, 78%, 77%, 76%, 75%, 70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 0%. Suitable assays for measuring the expression of a target gene or target sequence include, but are not limited to, examination of protein or mRNA levels using techniques known to those of skill in the art, such as, e.g., dot blots, Northern blots, in situ hybridization, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, enzyme function, as well as phenotypic assays known to those of skill in the art.
The term "nucleic acid" as used herein refers to a polymer containing at least two nucleotides (i.e., deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides) in either single- or double-stranded form and includes DNA and RNA. "Nucleotides" contain a sugar deoxyribose (DNA) or ribose (RNA), a base, and a phosphate group. Nucleotides are linked together through the phosphate groups. "Bases" include purines and pyrimidines, which further include natural compounds adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, inosine, and natural analogs, and synthetic derivatives of purines and pyrimidines, which include, but are not limited to, modifications which place new reactive groups such as, but not limited to, amines, alcohols, thiols, carboxylates, and alkylhalides. Nucleic acids include nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, and which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid. Examples of such analogs and/or modified residues include, without limitation,
phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral -methyl phosphonates, 2'-0- methyl ribonucleotides, and peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs). Additionally, nucleic acids can include one or more UNA moieties.
The term "nucleic acid" includes any oligonucleotide or polynucleotide, with fragments containing up to 60 nucleotides generally termed oligonucleotides, and longer fragments termed polynucleotides. A deoxyribooligonucleotide consists of a 5-carbon sugar called deoxyribose joined covalently to phosphate at the 5' and 3' carbons of this sugar to form an alternating, unbranched polymer. DNA may be in the form of, e.g., antisense molecules, plasmid DNA, pre- condensed DNA, a PCR product, vectors, expression cassettes, chimeric sequences,
chromosomal DNA, or derivatives and combinations of these groups. A ribooligonucleotide consists of a similar repeating structure where the 5-carbon sugar is ribose. RNA may be in the form, for example, of small interfering RNA (siRNA), Dicer-substrate dsRNA, small hairpin RNA (shRNA), asymmetrical interfering RNA (aiRNA), microRNA (miRNA), mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, tRNA, viral RNA (vRNA), and combinations thereof. Accordingly, in the context of this invention, the terms "polynucleotide" and "oligonucleotide" refer to a polymer or oligomer of nucleotide or nucleoside monomers consisting of naturally-occurring bases, sugars and intersugar (backbone) linkages. The terms "polynucleotide" and "oligonucleotide" also include polymers or oligomers comprising non -naturally occurring monomers, or portions thereof, which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, reduced immunogenicity, and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.
Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly
encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions), alleles, orthologs, SNPs, and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res., 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., J. Biol Chem., 260:2605-2608 (1985); Rossolini et al., Mol. Cell. Probes, 8:91-98 (1994)).
Described herein are isolated or substantially purified nucleic acid molecules and compositions containing those molecules, which may be used in methods of the invention. In the context of the present invention, an "isolated" or "purified" DNA molecule or RNA molecule is a DNA molecule or RNA molecule that exists apart from its native environment. An isolated DNA molecule or RNA molecule may exist in a purified form or may exist in a non- native environment such as, for example, a transgenic host cell. For example, an "isolated" or "purified" nucleic acid molecule or biologically active portion thereof, is substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. In one embodiment, an "isolated" nucleic acid is free of sequences that naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb, or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences that naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived.
The term "gene" refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA) sequence that comprises partial length or entire length coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide or precursor polypeptide.
"Gene product," as used herein, refers to a product of a gene such as an RNA transcript or a polypeptide.
The term "unlocked nucleobase analogue" (abbreviated as "UNA") refers to an acyclic nucleobase in which the C2' and C3' atoms of the ribose ring are not covalently linked. The term "unlocked nucleobase analogue" includes nucleobase analogues having the following structure identified as Structure A:
Structure A
wherein R is hydroxyl, and Base is any natural or unnatural base such as, for example, adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). UNA useful in the practice of the present invention include the molecules identified as acyclic 2'-3 '-seco-nucleotide monomers in U. S. patent serial number 8,314,227 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
The term "lipid" refers to a group of organic compounds that include, but are not limited to, esters of fatty acids and are characterized by being insoluble in water, but soluble in many organic solvents. They are usually divided into at least three classes: (1) "simple lipids," which include fats and oils as well as waxes; (2) "compound lipids," which include phospholipids and glycolipids; and (3) "derived lipids" such as steroids.
The term "lipid particle" includes a lipid formulation that can be used to deliver a therapeutic nucleic acid (e.g., siRNA) to a target site of interest (e.g., cell, tissue, organ, and the like). In preferred embodiments, the lipid particle of the invention is typically formed from a cationic lipid, a non-cationic lipid, and optionally a conjugated lipid that prevents aggregation of the particle. A lipid particle that includes a nucleic acid molecule (e.g. , siRNA molecule) is referred to as a nucleic acid-lipid particle. Typically, the nucleic acid is fully encapsulated within the lipid particle, thereby protecting the nucleic acid from enzymatic degradation.
In certain instances, nucleic acid-lipid particles are extremely useful for systemic applications, as they can exhibit extended circulation lifetimes following intravenous (i.v.) injection, they can accumulate at distal sites (e.g., sites physically separated from the administration site), and they can mediate silencing of target gene expression at these distal sites. The nucleic acid may be complexed with a condensing agent and encapsulated within a lipid particle as set forth in PCT Publication No. WO 00/03683, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.
The lipid particles of the invention typically have a mean diameter of from about 30 nm to about 150 nm, from about 40 nm to about 150 nm, from about 50 nm to about 150 nm, from about 60 nm to about 130 nm, from about 70 nm to about 110 nm, from about 70 nm to about 100 nm, from about 80 nm to about 100 nm, from about 90 nm to about 100 nm, from about 70 to about 90 nm, from about 80 nm to about 90 nm, from about 70 nm to about 80 nm, or about 30 nm, 35 nm, 40 nm, 45 nm, 50 nm, 55 nm, 60 nm, 65 nm, 70 nm, 75 nm, 80 nm, 85 nm, 90 nm, 95 nm, 100 nm, 105 nm, 110 nm, 115 nm, 120 nm, 125 nm, 130 nm, 135 nm, 140 nm, 145 nm, or 150 nm, and are substantially non-toxic. In addition, nucleic acids, when present in the lipid particles of the present invention, are resistant in aqueous solution to degradation with a nuclease. Nucleic acid-lipid particles and their method of preparation are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20040142025 and 20070042031, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
As used herein, "lipid encapsulated" can refer to a lipid particle that provides a therapeutic nucleic acid such as a siRNA, with full encapsulation, partial encapsulation, or both. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid (e.g., siRNA) is fully encapsulated in the lipid particle (e.g., to form a nucleic acid-lipid particle).
The term "lipid conjugate" refers to a conjugated lipid that inhibits aggregation of lipid particles. Such lipid conjugates include, but are not limited to, PEG-lipid conjugates such as, e.g., PEG coupled to dialkyloxypropyls (e.g., PEG-DAA conjugates), PEG coupled to diacylglycerols (e.g., PEG-DAG conjugates), PEG coupled to cholesterol, PEG coupled to phosphatidylethanolamines, and PEG conjugated to ceramides (see, e.g., U.

5,885,613), cationic PEG lipids, polyoxazoline (POZ)-lipid conjugates (e.g., POZ-DAA conjugates), polyamide oligomers (e.g., ATTA-lipid conjugates), and mixtures thereof.
Additional examples of POZ-lipid conjugates are described in PCT Publication No. WO
2010/006282. PEG or POZ can be conjugated directly to the lipid or may be linked to the lipid via a linker moiety. Any linker moiety suitable for coupling the PEG or the POZ to a lipid can be used including, e.g., non-ester containing linker moieties and ester-containing linker moieties. In certain preferred embodiments, non-ester containing linker moieties, such as amides or carbamates, are used.
The term "amphipathic lipid" refers, in part, to any suitable material wherein the hydrophobic portion of the lipid material orients into a hydrophobic phase, while the hydrophilic portion orients toward the aqueous phase. Hydrophilic characteristics derive from the presence of polar or charged groups such as carbohydrates, phosphate, carboxylic, sulfato, amino, sulfhydryl, nitro, hydroxyl, and other like groups. Hydrophobicity can be conferred by the inclusion of apolar groups that include, but are not limited to, long-chain saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups and such groups substituted by one or more aromatic, cycloaliphatic, or heterocyclic group(s). Examples of amphipathic compounds include, but are not limited to, phospholipids, aminolipids, and sphingolipids.

Additionally, the amphipathic lipids described above can be mixed with other lipids including triglycerides and sterols.
The term "neutral lipid" refers to any of a number of lipid species that exist either in an uncharged or neutral zwitterionic form at a selected pH. At physiological pH, such lipids include, for example, diacylphosphatidylcholine, diacylphosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide, sphingomyelin, cephalin, cholesterol, cerebrosides, and diacylglycerols.
The term "non-cationic lipid" refers to any amphipathic lipid as well as any other neutral lipid or anionic lipid.

The term "hydrophobic lipid" refers to compounds having apolar groups that include, but are not limited to, long-chain saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups and such groups optionally substituted by one or more aromatic, cycloaliphatic, or heterocyclic group(s). Suitable examples include, but are not limited to, diacylglycerol, dialkylglycerol, N-N- dialkylamino, l,2-diacyloxy-3-aminopropane, and l,2-dialkyl-3-aminopropane.
The terms "cationic lipid" and "amino lipid" are used interchangeably herein to include those lipids and salts thereof having one, two, three, or more fatty acid or fatty alkyl chains and a pH-titratable amino head group (e.g., an alkylamino or dialkylamino head group). The cationic lipid is typically protonated (i.e., positively charged) at a pH below the pKa of the cationic lipid and is substantially neutral at a pH above the pKa. The cationic lipids of the invention may also be termed titratable cationic lipids. In some embodiments, the cationic lipids comprise: a protonatable tertiary amine (e.g., pH-titratable) head group; C18 alkyl chains, wherein each alkyl chain independently has 0 to 3 (e.g., 0, 1, 2, or 3) double bonds; and ether, ester, or ketal linkages between the head group and alkyl chains. Such cationic lipids include, but are not limited to, DSDMA, DODMA, DLinDMA, DLenDMA, γ-DLenDMA, DLin-K-DMA, DLin-K- C2-DMA (also known as DLin-C2K-DMA, XTC2, and C2K), DLin-K-C3-DMA, DLin-K-C4- DMA, DLen-C2K-DMA, y-DLen-C2K-DMA, DLin-M-C2-DMA (also known as MC2), and DLin-M-C3 -DMA (also known as MC3).
The term "salts" includes any anionic and cationic complex, such as the complex formed between a cationic lipid and one or more anions.

As used herein, the term "aqueous solution" refers to a composition comprising in whole, or in part, water.
As used herein, the term "organic lipid solution" refers to a composition comprising in whole, or in part, an organic solvent having a lipid.
The term "electron dense core", when used to describe a lipid particle described herein, refers to the dark appearance of the interior portion of a lipid particle when visualized using cryo transmission electron microscopy ("cyroTEM"). Some lipid particles of the present invention have an electron dense core and lack a lipid bilayer structure. Some lipid particles of the present invention have an electron dense core, lack a lipid bilayer structure, and have an inverse Hexagonal or Cubic phase structure.

"Systemic delivery," as used herein, refers to delivery of lipid particles that leads to a broad biodistribution of an active agent such as a siRNA within an organism. Some techniques of administration can lead to the systemic delivery of certain agents, but not others. Systemic delivery means that a useful, preferably therapeutic, amount of an agent is exposed to most parts of the body. To obtain broad biodistribution generally requires a blood lifetime such that the agent is not rapidly degraded or cleared (such as by first pass organs (liver, lung, etc.) or by rapid, nonspecific cell binding) before reaching a disease site distal to the site of administration. Systemic delivery of lipid particles can be by any means known in the art including, for example, intravenous, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal. In a preferred embodiment, systemic delivery of lipid particles is by intravenous delivery.
"Local delivery," as used herein, refers to delivery of an active agent such as a siRNA directly to a target site within an organism. For example, an agent can be locally delivered by direct injection into a disease site, other target site, or a target organ such as the liver, heart, pancreas, kidney, and the like.
The term "virus particle load", as used herein, refers to a measure of the number of virus particles (e.g., HBV and/or HDV) present in a bodily fluid, such as blood. For example, particle load may be expressed as the number of virus particles per milliliter of, e.g., blood. Particle load testing may be performed using nucleic acid amplification based tests, as well as non-nucleic acid-based tests (see, e.g., Puren et al., The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 201 :S27-36 (2010)).
The term "mammal" refers to any mammalian species such as a human, mouse, rat, dog, cat, hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, livestock, and the like.
Generating siRNA Molecules
siRNA can be provided in several forms including, e.g., as one or more isolated small- interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, as longer double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), or as siRNA or dsRNA transcribed from a transcriptional cassette in a DNA plasmid. In some embodiments, siRNA may be produced enzymatically or by partial/total organic synthesis, and modified ribonucleotides can be introduced by in vitro enzymatic or organic synthesis. In certain instances, each strand is prepared chemically. Methods of synthesizing RNA molecules are known in the art, e.g., the chemical synthesis methods as described in Verma and Eckstein (1998) or as described herein.
Methods for isolating RNA, synthesizing RNA, hybridizing nucleic acids, making and screening cDNA libraries, and performing PCR are well known in the art (see, e.g., Gubler and Hoffman, Gene, 25 :263-269 (1983); Sambrook et al, supra; Ausubel et al, supra), as are PCR methods (see, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683, 195 and 4,683,202; PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications (Innis et al., eds, 1990)). Expression libraries are also well known to those of skill in the art. Additional basic texts disclosing the general methods of use in this invention include Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (2nd ed. 1989); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual (1990); and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel et al , eds., 1994). The disclosures of these references are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. Preferably, siRNA are chemically synthesized. The oligonucleotides that comprise the siRNA molecules of the invention can be synthesized using any of a variety of techniques known in the art, such as those described in Usman et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 109:7845 (1987); Scaringe et al, Nucl. Acids Res. , 18:5433 (1990); Wincott et al. , Nucl. Acids Res., 23 :2677-2684 (1995); and Wincott et al, Methods Mol. Bio., 74:59 (1997). The synthesis of oligonucleotides makes use of common nucleic acid protecting and coupling groups, such as dimethoxytrityl at the 5'-end and phosphoramidites at the 3'-end. As a non-limiting example, small scale syntheses can be conducted on an Applied Biosystems synthesizer using a 0.2 μιηοΐ scale protocol. Alternatively, syntheses at the 0.2 μιηοΐ scale can be performed on a 96-well plate synthesizer from Protogene (Palo Alto, CA). However, a larger or smaller scale of synthesis is also within the scope of this invention. Suitable reagents for oligonucleotide synthesis, methods for RNA deprotection, and methods for RNA purification are known to those of skill in the art.
siRNA molecules can be assembled from two distinct oligonucleotides, wherein one oligonucleotide comprises the sense strand and the other comprises the antisense strand of the siRNA. For example, each strand can be synthesized separately and joined together by hybridization or ligation following synthesis and/or deprotection.
Carrier Systems Containing Therapeutic Nucleic Acids
A. Lipid Particles
In certain aspects, lipid particles comprising one or more oligonucleotides {e.g. , one or more siRNA molecules, such as one or more siRNA molecules described in Tables A and B) and one or more of cationic (amino) lipids or salts thereof, may be administered. In some embodiments, the lipid particles described herein further comprise one or more non-cationic lipids. In other embodiments, the lipid particles further comprise one or more conjugated lipids capable of reducing or inhibiting particle aggregation. The lipid particles of the invention are useful, for example, for delivering a therapeutically effective amount of siRNA into cells (e.g. , liver cells) of a human body infected with HBV or HBV/HDV, thereby treating the HBV infection and/or HDV infection and/or ameliorating one or more symptoms of HBV infection and/or HDV infection.
With respect to formulations that include a cocktail of siRNAs encapsulated within lipid particles, the different siRNA molecules may be co-encapsulated in the same lipid particle, or each type of siRNA species present in the cocktail may be encapsulated in its own particle, or some siRNA species may be coencapsulated in the same particle while other siRNA species are encapsulated in different particles within the formulation. Typically, the siRNA molecules of the invention are fully encapsulated in the lipid particle. The lipid particles described herein preferably comprise one or more siRNA (e.g., siRNA molecules described in Tables A and B), a cationic lipid, a non-cationic lipid, and a conjugated lipid that inhibits aggregation of particles. In some embodiments, the siRNA molecule is fully encapsulated within the lipid portion of the lipid particle such that the siRNA molecule in the lipid particle is resistant in aqueous solution to nuclease degradation. In other embodiments, the lipid particles described herein are substantially non-toxic to mammals such as humans. The lipid particles typically have a mean diameter of from about 30 nm to about 150 nm, from about 40 nm to about 150 nm, from about 50 nm to about 150 nm, from about 60 nm to about 130 nm, from about 70 nm to about 1 10 nm, or from about 70 to about 90 nm. In certain embodiments, the lipid particles have a median diameter of from about 30 nm to about 150 nm. The lipid particles also typically have a lipid:nucleic acid ratio (e.g., a lipid:siRNA ratio) (mass/mass ratio) of from about 1 : 1 to about 100: 1, from about 1 : 1 to about 50: 1, from about 2 : 1 to about 25 : 1, from about 3 : 1 to about 20: 1, from about 5 : 1 to about 15 : 1 , or from about 5 : 1 to about 10: 1. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid-lipid particle has a lipid: siRNA mass ratio of from about 5 : 1 to about 15 : 1.
In preferred embodiments, the lipid particles are serum-stable nucleic acid-lipid particles which comprise one or more siRNA molecules (e.g., a siRNA molecule as described in Tables A and B), a cationic lipid {e.g., one or more cationic lipids of Formula ZI-ZIII or salts thereof as set forth herein), a non-cationic lipid (e.g., mixtures of one or more phospholipids and cholesterol), and a conjugated lipid that inhibits aggregation of the particles (e.g., one or more PEG-lipid conjugates). The lipid particle may comprise at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more siRNA molecules (e.g., siRNA molecules described in Tables A and B) that target one or more of the genes described herein. Nucleic acid-lipid particles and their method of preparation are described in, e.g., U. S. Patent Nos. 5,753,613; 5,785,992; 5,705,385; 5,976,567; 5,981,501 ; 6, 110,745; and 6,320,017; and PCT Publication No. WO 96/40964, the disclosures of which are each herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
In the nucleic acid-lipid particles described herein, the one or more siRNA molecules (e.g., an siRNA molecule as described in Tables A and B) may be fully encapsulated within the lipid portion of the particle, thereby protecting the siRNA from nuclease degradation. In certain instances, the siRNA in the nucleic acid-lipid particle is not substantially degraded after exposure of the particle to a nuclease at 37°C for at least about 20, 30, 45, or 60 minutes. In certain other instances, the siRNA in the nucleic acid-lipid particle is not substantially degraded after incubation of the particle in serum at 37°C for at least about 30, 45, or 60 minutes or at least about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, or 36 hours. In other embodiments, the siRNA is complexed with the lipid portion of the particle. One of the benefits of the formulations of the present invention is that the nucleic acid-lipid particle compositions are substantially non-toxic to mammals such as humans.
The term "fully encapsulated" indicates that the siRNA (e.g., a siRNA molecule as described in Tables A and B) in the nucleic acid-lipid particle is not significantly degraded after exposure to serum or a nuclease assay that would significantly degrade free DNA or RNA. In a fully encapsulated system, preferably less than about 25% of the siRNA in the particle is degraded in a treatment that would normally degrade 100% of free siRNA, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the siRNA in the particle is degraded. "Fully encapsulated" also indicates that the nucleic acid-lipid particles are serum- stable, that is, that they do not rapidly decompose into their component parts upon in vivo administration.
In the context of nucleic acids, full encapsulation may be determined by performing a membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye exclusion assay, which uses a dye that has enhanced fluorescence when associated with nucleic acid. Specific dyes such as OliGreen® and
RiboGreen® (Invitrogen Corp.; Carlsbad, CA) are available for the quantitative determination of plasmid DNA, single-stranded deoxyribonucleotides, and/or single- or double-stranded ribonucleotides. Encapsulation is determined by adding the dye to a liposomal formulation, measuring the resulting fluorescence, and comparing it to the fluorescence observed upon addition of a small amount of nonionic detergent. Detergent-mediated disruption of the liposomal bilayer releases the encapsulated nucleic acid, allowing it to interact with the membrane-impermeable dye. Nucleic acid encapsulation may be calculated as E = (I0 - I)/I0, where / and I0 refer to the fluorescence intensities before and after the addition of detergent (see, Wheeler et al., Gene Ther., 6:271-281 (1999)).
In other embodiments, the present invention provides a nucleic acid-lipid particle composition comprising a plurality of nucleic acid-lipid particles.
In some instances, the nucleic acid-lipid particle composition comprises a siRNA molecule that is fully encapsulated within the lipid portion of the particles, such that from about 30% to about 100%, from about 40% to about 100%, from about 50% to about 100%, from about 60% to about 100%, from about 70% to about 100%, from about 80% to about 100%, from about 90% to about 100%, from about 30% to about 95%, from about 40% to about 95%, from about 50% to about 95%, from about 60% to about 95%, from about 70% to about 95%, from about 80% to about 95%, from about 85% to about 95%, from about 90% to about 95%, from about 30% to about 90%, from about 40% to about 90%, from about 50% to about 90%, from about 60% to about 90%, from about 70% to about 90%, from about 80% to about 90%, or at least about 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% (or any fraction thereof or range therein) of the particles have the siRNA encapsulated therein.
In other instances, the nucleic acid-lipid particle composition comprises siRNA that is fully encapsulated within the lipid portion of the particles, such that from about 30% to about 100%, from about 40% to about 100%, from about 50% to about 100%, from about 60% to about 100%, from about 70% to about 100%, from about 80% to about 100%, from about 90% to about 100%, from about 30% to about 95%, from about 40% to about 95%, from about 50% to about 95%, from about 60% to about 95%, from about 70% to about 95%, from about 80% to about 95%, from about 85% to about 95%, from about 90% to about 95%, from about 30% to about 90%, from about 40% to about 90%, from about 50% to about 90%, from about 60% to about 90%, from about 70% to about 90%, from about 80% to about 90%, or at least about 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% (or any fraction thereof or range therein) of the input siRNA is encapsulated in the particles.
Depending on the intended use of the lipid particles of the invention, the proportions of the components can be varied and the delivery efficiency of a particular formulation can be measured using, e.g., an endosomal release parameter (ERP) assay.
The nucleic acid-lipid particles described herein are useful for the prophylactic or therapeutic delivery, into a human infected with HBV or HBV/HDV, of siRNA molecules that silence the expression of one or more HBV genes, thereby ameliorating at least one symptom of HBV infection and/or HDV infection in the human. In some embodiments, one or more of the siRNA molecules described herein are formulated into nucleic acid-lipid particles, and the particles are administered to a mammal (e.g., a human) requiring such treatment. In certain instances, a therapeutically effective amount of the nucleic acid-lipid particle can be
administered to the mammal, (e.g., for treating HBV and/or HDV infection in a human being). The nucleic acid-lipid particles described herein are particularly useful for targeting liver cells in humans which is the site of most HBV gene expression. Administration of the nucleic acid-lipid particle can be by any route known in the art, such as, e.g., oral, intranasal, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intra-articular, intralesional, intratracheal, subcutaneous, or intradermal. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid-lipid particle is administered systemically, e.g., via enteral or parenteral routes of administration. In some embodiments, downregulation of HBV gene expression is determined by detecting HBV RNA or protein levels in a biological sample from a mammal after nucleic acid- lipid particle administration. In other embodiments, downregulation of HBV gene expression is determined by detecting HBV mRNA or protein levels in a biological sample from a mammal after nucleic acid-lipid particle administration. In certain embodiments, downregulation of HBV gene expression is detected by monitoring symptoms associated with HBV infection in a mammal after particle administration.

PEG is a linear, water-soluble polymer of ethylene PEG repeating units with two terminal hydroxyl groups. PEGs are classified by their molecular weights; for example, PEG 2000 has an average molecular weight of about 2,000 daltons, and PEG 5000 has an average molecular weight of about 5,000 daltons. PEGs are commercially available from Sigma Chemical Co. and other companies and include, but are not limited to, the following:

Other PEGs such as those described in U. S. Patent Nos. 6,774, 180 and 7,053, 150 (e.g., mPEG (20 KDa) amine) are also useful for preparing the PEG-lipid conjugates of the present invention. The disclosures of these patents are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. In addition, monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol-acetic acid (MePEG-ClHhCOOH) is particularly useful for preparing PEG-lipid conjugates including, e.g., PEG-DAA conjugates. The PEG moiety of the PEG-lipid conjugates described herein may comprise an average molecular weight ranging from about 550 daltons to about 10,000 daltons. In certain instances, the PEG moiety has an average molecular weight of from about 750 daltons to about 5,000 daltons (e.g., from about 1,000 daltons to about 5,000 daltons, from about 1 ,500 daltons to about 3,000 daltons, from about 750 daltons to about 3,000 daltons, from about 750 daltons to about 2,000 daltons, etc. ). In preferred embodiments, the PEG moiety has an average molecular weight of about 2,000 daltons or about 750 daltons.
In certain instances, the PEG can be optionally substituted by an alkyl, alkoxy, acyl, or aryl group. The PEG can be conjugated directly to the lipid or may be linked to the lipid via a linker moiety. Any linker moiety suitable for coupling the PEG to a lipid can be used including, e.g., non-ester containing linker moieties and ester-containing linker moieties. In a preferred embodiment, the linker moiety is a non-ester containing linker moiety.

NHC(O)NH-), disulphide (-S-S-), ether (-0-), succinyl (-(0)CCH2CH2C(0)-), succinamidyl (- NHC(0)CH2CH2C(0)NH-), ether, disulphide, as well as combinations thereof (such as a linker containing both a carbamate linker moiety and an amido linker moiety). In a preferred embodiment, a carbamate linker is used to couple the PEG to the lipid.
In other embodiments, an ester containing linker moiety is used to couple the PEG to the lipid. Suitable ester containing linker moieties include, e.g., carbonate (-OC(O)O-), succinoyl, phosphate esters (-O-(O)POH-O-), sulfonate esters, and combinations thereof.
Phosphatidylethanolamines having a variety of acyl chain groups of varying chain lengths and degrees of saturation can be conjugated to PEG to form the lipid conjugate. Such phosphatidylethanolamines are commercially available, or can be isolated or synthesized using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art. Phosphatidyl-ethanolamines containing saturated or unsaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of Cio to C20 are preferred.

The PEG-DAA conjugates are synthesized using standard techniques and reagents known to those of skill in the art. It will be recognized that the PEG-DAA conjugates will contain various amide, amine, ether, thio, carbamate, and urea linkages. Those of skill in the art will recognize that methods and reagents for forming these bonds are well known and readily available. See, e.g., March, ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (Wiley 1992); Larock,
COMPREHENSIVE ORGANIC TRANSFORMATIONS (VCH 1989); and Furaiss, VOGEL' S TEXTBOOK OF PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 5th ed. (Longman 1989). It will also be appreciated that any functional groups present may require protection and deprotection at different points in the synthesis of the PEG-DAA conjugates. Those of skill in the art will recognize that such techniques are well known. See, e.g., Green and Wuts, PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS (Wiley 1991).

In particular embodiments, the terminal hydroxyl group of the PEG is substituted with a methyl group.
Those of skill in the art will readily appreciate that other dialkyloxypropyls can be used in the PEG-DAA conjugates of the present invention. In addition to the foregoing, it will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art that other hydrophilic polymers can be used in place of PEG. Examples of suitable polymers that can be used in place of PEG include, but are not limited to, polyvinylpyrrolidone,
polymethyloxazoline, polyethyloxazoline, polyhydroxypropyl methacrylamide,
polymethacrylamide and polydimethylacrylamide, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, and derivatized celluloses such as hydroxymethyl cellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose.
In addition to the foregoing components, the lipid particles of the present invention can further comprise cationic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipids or CPLs (see, e.g., Chen et al, Bioconj. Chem., 11 :433-437 (2000); U. S. Patent No. 6,852,334; PCT Publication No. WO 00/62813, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes).
Suitable CPLs include compounds of Formula ZVIII:
A-W-Y (ZVIII),
wherein A, W, and Y are as described below.
With reference to Formula ZVIII, "A" is a lipid moiety such as an amphipathic lipid, a neutral lipid, or a hydrophobic lipid that acts as a lipid anchor. Suitable lipid examples include, but are not limited to, diacylglycerolyls, dialkylglycerolyls, N-N-dialkylaminos, 1,2-diacyloxy- 3-aminopropanes, and l,2-dialkyl-3-aminopropanes.
"W" is a polymer or an oligomer such as a hydrophilic polymer or oligomer.
Preferably, the hydrophilic polymer is a biocompatable polymer that is nonimmunogenic or possesses low inherent immunogenicity. Alternatively, the hydrophilic polymer can be weakly antigenic if used with appropriate adjuvants. Suitable nonimmunogenic polymers include, but are not limited to, PEG, polyamides, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polylactic
acid/polyglycolic acid copolymers, and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the polymer has a molecular weight of from about 250 to about 7,000 daltons.
"Y" is a polycationic moiety. The term polycationic moiety refers to a compound, derivative, or functional group having a positive charge, preferably at least 2 positive charges at a selected pH, preferably physiological pH. Suitable polycationic moieties include basic amino acids and their derivatives such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, lysine, and histidine;
spermine; spermidine; cationic dendrimers; polyamines; polyamine sugars; and amino polysaccharides. The polycationic moieties can be linear, such as linear tetralysine, branched or dendrimeric in structure. Polycationic moieties have between about 2 to about 15 positive charges, preferably between about 2 to about 12 positive charges, and more preferably between about 2 to about 8 positive charges at selected pH values. The selection of which polycationic moiety to employ may be determined by the type of particle application which is desired.
The charges on the polycationic moieties can be either distributed around the entire particle moiety, or alternatively, they can be a discrete concentration of charge density in one particular area of the particle moiety e.g., a charge spike. If the charge density is distributed on the particle, the charge density can be equally distributed or unequally distributed. All variations of charge distribution of the polycationic moiety are encompassed by the present invention.
The lipid "A" and the nonimmunogenic polymer "W" can be attached by various methods and preferably by covalent attachment. Methods known to those of skill in the art can be used for the covalent attachment of "A" and "W." Suitable linkages include, but are not limited to, amide, amine, carboxyl, carbonate, carbamate, ester, and hydrazone linkages. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that "A" and "W" must have complementary functional groups to effectuate the linkage. The reaction of these two groups, one on the lipid and the other on the polymer, will provide the desired linkage. For example, when the lipid is a diacyl glycerol and the terminal hydroxyl is activated, for instance with NHS and DCC, to form an active ester, and is then reacted with a polymer which contains an amino group, such as with a polyamide (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,320,017 and 6,586,559, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes), an amide bond will form between the two groups.
In certain instances, the polycationic moiety can have a ligand attached, such as a targeting ligand or a chelating moiety for complexing calcium. Preferably, after the ligand is attached, the cationic moiety maintains a positive charge. In certain instances, the ligand that is attached has a positive charge. Suitable ligands include, but are not limited to, a compound or device with a reactive functional group and include lipids, amphipathic lipids, carrier compounds, bioaffinity compounds, biomaterials, biopolymers, biomedical devices, analytically detectable compounds, therapeutically active compounds, enzymes, peptides, proteins, antibodies, immune stimulators, radiolabels, fluorogens, biotin, drugs, haptens, DNA, RNA, polysaccharides, liposomes, virosomes, micelles, immunoglobulins, functional groups, other targeting moieties, or toxins.
In some embodiments, the lipid conjugate (e.g., PEG-lipid) comprises from about 0.1 mol % to about 3 mol %, from about 0.5 mol % to about 3 mol %, or about 0.6 mol %, 0.7 mol %, 0.8 mol %, 0.9 mol %, 1.0 mol %, 1.1 mol %, 1.2 mol %, 1.3 mol %, 1.4 mol %, 1.5 mol %, 1.6 mol %, 1.7 mol %, 1.8 mol %, 1.9 mol %, 2.0 mol %, 2.1 mol%, 2.2 mol%, 2.3 mol %, 2.4 mol %, 2.5 mol %, 2.6 mol %, 2.7 mol %, 2.8 mol %, 2.9 mol % or 3 mol % (or any fraction thereof or range therein) of the total lipid present in the particle.
In other embodiments, the lipid conjugate (e.g., PEG-lipid) comprises from about 0 mol % to about 20 mol %, from about 0.5 mol % to about 20 mol %, from about 2 mol % to about 20 mol %, from about 1.5 mol % to about 18 mol %, from about 2 mol % to about 15 mol %, from about 4 mol % to about 15 mol %, from about 2 mol % to about 12 mol %, from about 5 mol % to about 12 mol %, or about 2 mol % (or any fraction thereof or range therein) of the total lipid present in the particle.
In further embodiments, the lipid conjugate (e.g., PEG-lipid) comprises from about 4 mol % to about 10 mol %, from about 5 mol % to about 10 mol %, from about 5 mol % to about 9 mol %, from about 5 mol % to about 8 mol %, from about 6 mol % to about 9 mol %, from about 6 mol % to about 8 mol %, or about 5 mol %, 6 mol %, 7 mol %, 8 mol %, 9 mol %, or 10 mol % (or any fraction thereof or range therein) of the total lipid present in the particle.
It should be understood that the percentage of lipid conjugate present in the lipid particles of the invention is a target amount, and that the actual amount of lipid conjugate present in the formulation may vary, for example, by ± 5 mol %, ± 4 mol %, ± 3 mol %, ± 2 mol %, ± 1 mol %, ± 0.75 mol %, ± 0.5 mol %, ± 0.25 mol %, or ± 0.1 mol %.
Additional percentages and ranges of lipid conjugates suitable for use in the lipid particles of the present invention are described in PCT Publication No. WO 09/127060, U. S. Published Application No. US 2011/0071208, PCT Publication No. WO2011/000106, and U.S. Published Application No. US 2011/0076335, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the concentration of the lipid conjugate can be varied depending on the lipid conjugate employed and the rate at which the lipid particle is to become fusogenic.
By controlling the composition and concentration of the lipid conjugate, one can control the rate at which the lipid conjugate exchanges out of the lipid particle and, in turn, the rate at which the lipid particle becomes fusogenic. For instance, when a PEG-DAA conjugate is used as the lipid conjugate, the rate at which the lipid particle becomes fusogenic can be varied, for example, by varying the concentration of the lipid conjugate, by varying the molecular weight of the PEG, or by varying the chain length and degree of saturation of the alkyl groups on the PEG-DAA conjugate. In addition, other variables including, for example, pH, temperature, ionic strength, etc. can be used to vary and/or control the rate at which the lipid particle becomes fusogenic. Other methods which can be used to control the rate at which the lipid particle becomes fusogenic will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this disclosure. Also, by controlling the composition and concentration of the lipid conjugate, one can control the lipid particle size.

To form a polyplex, a nucleic acid (e.g., a siRNA molecule, such as an siRNA molecule described in Tables A and B) is typically complexed with a cationic polymer having a linear, branched, star, or dendritic polymeric structure that condenses the nucleic acid into positively charged particles capable of interacting with anionic proteoglycans at the cell surface and entering cells by endocytosis.

Preparation of Lipid Particles
Nucleic acid-lipid particles, in which a nucleic acid (e.g., a siRNA as described in
Tables A and B) is entrapped within the lipid portion of the particle and is protected from degradation, can be formed by any method known in the art including, but not limited to, a continuous mixing method, a direct dilution process, and an in-line dilution process. In particular embodiments, the cationic lipids may comprise lipids of Formula ZI-III or salts thereof, alone or in combination with other cationic lipids. In other embodiments, the non- cationic lipids are egg sphingomyelin (ESM), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dioleoylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC), l -palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), monomethyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, dimethyl- phosphatidylethanolamine, 14:0 PE (1,2-dimyristoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE)), 16:0 PE (1,2-dipalmitoyl -phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE)), 18:0 PE (1,2-distearoyl- phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)), 18: 1 PE (1,2-dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)), 18: 1 trans PE (1,2-dielaidoyl -phosphatidylethanolamine (DEPE)), 18:0-18: 1 PE (l-stearoyl-2- oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (SOPE)), 16:0-18: 1 PE (l-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE)), polyethylene glycol-based polymers (e.g., PEG 2000, PEG 5000, PEG-modified diacylglycerols, or PEG-modified dialkyloxypropyls), cholesterol, derivatives thereof, or combinations thereof.
In certain embodiments, the present invention provides nucleic acid-lipid particles produced via a continuous mixing method, e.g., a process that includes providing an aqueous solution comprising a siRNA in a first reservoir, providing an organic lipid solution in a second reservoir (wherein the lipids present in the organic lipid solution are solubilized in an organic solvent, e.g., a lower alkanol such as ethanol), and mixing the aqueous solution with the organic lipid solution such that the organic lipid solution mixes with the aqueous solution so as to substantially instantaneously produce a lipid vesicle (e.g., liposome) encapsulating the siRNA within the lipid vesicle. This process and the apparatus for carrying out this process are described in detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040142025, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.
The action of continuously introducing lipid and buffer solutions into a mixing environment, such as in a mixing chamber, causes a continuous dilution of the lipid solution with the buffer solution, thereby producing a lipid vesicle substantially instantaneously upon mixing. As used herein, the phrase "continuously diluting a lipid solution with a buffer solution" (and variations) generally means that the lipid solution is diluted sufficiently rapidly in a hydration process with sufficient force to effectuate vesicle generation. By mixing the aqueous solution comprising a nucleic acid with the organic lipid solution, the organic lipid solution undergoes a continuous stepwise dilution in the presence of the buffer solution (i.e., aqueous solution) to produce a nucleic acid-lipid particle.
The nucleic acid-lipid particles formed using the continuous mixing method typically have a size of from about 30 nm to about 150 nm, from about 40 nm to about 150 nm, from about 50 nm to about 150 nm, from about 60 nm to about 130 nm, from about 70 nm to about 1 10 nm, from about 70 nm to about 100 nm, from about 80 nm to about 100 nm, from about 90 nm to about 100 nm, from about 70 to about 90 nm, from about 80 nm to about 90 nm, from about 70 nm to about 80 nm, less than about 120 nm, 1 10 nm, 100 nm, 90 nm, or 80 nm, or about 30 nm, 35 nm, 40 nm, 45 nm, 50 nm, 55 nm, 60 nm, 65 nm, 70 nm, 75 nm, 80 nm, 85 nm, 90 nm, 95 nm, 100 nm, 105 nm, 1 10 nm, 115 nm, 120 nm, 125 nm, 130 nm, 135 nm, 140 nm, 145 nm, or 150 nm (or any fraction thereof or range therein). The particles thus formed do not aggregate and are optionally sized to achieve a uniform particle size.
In another embodiment, the present invention provides nucleic acid-lipid particles produced via a direct dilution process that includes forming a lipid vesicle (e.g., liposome) solution and immediately and directly introducing the lipid vesicle solution into a collection vessel containing a controlled amount of dilution buffer. In preferred aspects, the collection vessel includes one or more elements configured to stir the contents of the collection vessel to facilitate dilution. In one aspect, the amount of dilution buffer present in the collection vessel is substantially equal to the volume of lipid vesicle solution introduced thereto. As a non-limiting example, a lipid vesicle solution in 45% ethanol when introduced into the collection vessel containing an equal volume of dilution buffer will advantageously yield smaller particles.
In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides nucleic acid-lipid particles produced via an in-line dilution process in which a third reservoir containing dilution buffer is fluidly coupled to a second mixing region. In this embodiment, the lipid vesicle (e.g., liposome) solution formed in a first mixing region is immediately and directly mixed with dilution buffer in the second mixing region. In preferred aspects, the second mixing region includes a T- connector arranged so that the lipid vesicle solution and the dilution buffer flows meet as opposing 180° flows; however, connectors providing shallower angles can be used, e.g., from about 27° to about 180° (e.g., about 90°). A pump mechanism delivers a controllable flow of buffer to the second mixing region. In one aspect, the flow rate of dilution buffer provided to the second mixing region is controlled to be substantially equal to the flow rate of lipid vesicle solution introduced thereto from the first mixing region. This embodiment advantageously allows for more control of the flow of dilution buffer mixing with the lipid vesicle solution in the second mixing region, and therefore also the concentration of lipid vesicle solution in buffer throughout the second mixing process. Such control of the dilution buffer flow rate
advantageously allows for small particle size formation at reduced concentrations. These processes and the apparatuses for carrying out these direct dilution and in-line dilution processes are described in detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070042031, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.
The nucleic acid-lipid particles formed using the direct dilution and in-line dilution processes typically have a size of from about 30 nm to about 150 nm, from about 40 nm to about 150 nm, from about 50 nm to about 150 nm, from about 60 nm to about 130 nm, from about 70 nm to about 110 nm, from about 70 nm to about 100 nm, from about 80 nm to about 100 nm, from about 90 nm to about 100 nm, from about 70 to about 90 nm, from about 80 nm to about 90 nm, from about 70 nm to about 80 nm, less than about 120 nm, 1 10 nm, 100 nm, 90 nm, or 80 nm, or about 30 nm, 35 nm, 40 nm, 45 nm, 50 nm, 55 nm, 60 nm, 65 nm, 70 nm, 75 nm, 80 nm, 85 nm, 90 nm, 95 nm, 100 nm, 105 nm, 1 10 nm, 1 15 nm, 120 nm, 125 nm, 130 nm, 135 nm, 140 nm, 145 nm, or 150 nm (or any fraction thereof or range therein). The particles thus formed do not aggregate and are optionally sized to achieve a uniform particle size.
If needed, the lipid particles of the invention can be sized by any of the methods available for sizing liposomes. The sizing may be conducted in order to achieve a desired size range and relatively narrow distribution of particle sizes.
Several techniques are available for sizing the particles to a desired size. One sizing method, used for liposomes and equally applicable to the present particles, is described in U. S. Patent No. 4,737,323, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Sonicating a particle suspension either by bath or probe sonication produces a progressive size reduction down to particles of less than about 50 nm in size. Homogenization is another method which relies on shearing energy to fragment larger particles into smaller ones. In a typical homogenization procedure, particles are recirculated through a standard emulsion homogenizer until selected particle sizes, typically between about 60 and about 80 nm, are observed. In both methods, the particle size distribution can be monitored by conventional laser-beam particle size discrimination, or QELS.
Extrusion of the particles through a small-pore polycarbonate membrane or an asymmetric ceramic membrane is also an effective method for reducing particle sizes to a relatively well-defined size distribution. Typically, the suspension is cycled through the membrane one or more times until the desired particle size distribution is achieved. The particles may be extruded through successively smaller-pore membranes, to achieve a gradual reduction in size. In some embodiments, the nucleic acids present in the particles (e.g., the siRNA molecules) are precondensed as described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Application No.09/744,103, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.
In other embodiments, the methods may further comprise adding non-lipid polycations which are useful to effect the lipofection of cells using the present compositions. Examples of suitable non-lipid polycations include, hexadimethrine bromide (sold under the brand name POLYBRENE®, from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) or other salts of hexadimethrine. Other suitable polycations include, for example, salts of poly-L-ornithine, poly-L-arginine, poly-L-lysine, poly-D-lysine, polyallylamine, and polyethyleneimine. Addition of these salts is preferably after the particles have been formed.
In some embodiments, the nucleic acid (e.g., siRNA) to lipid ratios (mass/mass ratios) in a formed nucleic acid-lipid particle will range from about 0.01 to about 0.2, from about 0.05 to about 0.2, from about 0.02 to about 0.1, from about 0.03 to about 0.1, or from about 0.01 to about 0.08. The ratio of the starting materials (input) also falls within this range. In other embodiments, the particle preparation uses about 400 μg nucleic acid per 10 mg total lipid or a nucleic acid to lipid mass ratio of about 0.01 to about 0.08 and, more preferably, about 0.04, which corresponds to 1.25 mg of total lipid per 50 μg of nucleic acid. In other preferred embodiments, the particle has a nucleic acid ipid mass ratio of about 0.08.
In other embodiments, the lipid to nucleic acid (e.g., siRNA) ratios (mass/mass ratios) in a formed nucleic acid-lipid particle will range from about 1 (1:1) to about 100 (100: 1), from about 5 (5:1) to about 100 (100:1), from about 1 (1:1) to about 50 (50:1), from about 2 (2:1) to about 50 (50:1), from about 3 (3:1) to about 50 (50:1), from about 4 (4:1) to about 50 (50:1), from about 5 (5: 1) to about 50 (50:1), from about 1 (1:1) to about 25 (25: 1), from about 2 (2: 1) to about 25 (25:1), from about3 (3:l)to about 25 (25:1), from about 4 (4:1) to about 25 (25:1), from about 5 (5:1) to about 25 (25:1), from about 5 (5:1) to about 20 (20:1), from about 5 (5:1) to about 15 (15:1), from about 5 (5:1) to about 10 (10:1), or about 5 (5:1), 6 (6:1), 7 (7:1), 8 (8:1), 9 (9:1), 10 (10:1), 11 (11:1), 12 (12:1), 13 (13:1), 14 (14:1), 15 (15:1), 16 (16:1), 17 (17:1), 18 (18:1), 19 (19:1), 20 (20:1), 21 (21:1), 22 (22:1), 23 (23:1), 24 (24:1), or 25 (25:1), or any fraction thereof or range therein. The ratio of the starting materials (input) also falls within this range.
As previously discussed, the conjugated lipid may further include a CPL. A variety of general methods for making lipid particle-CPLs (CPL-containing lipid particles) are discussed herein. Two general techniques include the "post-insertion" technique, that is, insertion of a CPL into, for example, a pre-formed lipid particle, and the "standard" technique, wherein the CPL is included in the lipid mixture during, for example, the lipid particle formation steps. The post-insertion technique results in lipid particles having CPLs mainly in the external face of the lipid particle bilayer membrane, whereas standard techniques provide lipid particles having CPLs on both internal and external faces. The method is especially useful for vesicles made from phospholipids (which can contain cholesterol) and also for vesicles containing PEG-lipids (such as PEG-DAAs and PEG-DAGs). Methods of making lipid particle-CPLs are taught, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,705,385; 6,586,410; 5,981,501 ; 6,534,484; and 6,852,334; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20020072121 ; and PCT Publication No. WO 00/62813, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

In other embodiments, administration of nucleic acid-lipid particles comprising one or more HBV- targeting siRNAs reduces HBV RNA levels for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 days or more (or any range therein) relative to a negative control such as, e.g., a buffer control or an irrelevant non-HBV targeting siRNA control.
In other aspects, HBV gene expression may be silenced in a mammal (e.g., human) in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a nucleic acid-lipid particle comprising one or more siRNAs described herein (e.g., siRNAs described in Tables A and B). In some embodiments, administration of nucleic acid- lipid particles comprising one or more HBV siRNAs reduces HBV mRNA levels by at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% (or any range therein) relative to HBV mRNA levels detected in the absence of the siRNA (e.g., buffer control or irrelevant non-HBV targeting siRNA control). In other embodiments, administration of nucleic acid-lipid particles comprising one or more HBV-targeting siRNAs reduces HBV mRNA levels for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 days or more (or any range therein) relative to a negative control such as, e.g., a buffer control or an irrelevant non-HBV targeting siRNA control.
Also described herein are methods for treating, preventing, reducing the risk or likelihood of developing (e.g., reducing the susceptibility to), delaying the onset of, and/or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with HBV and/or HDV infection in a mammal (e.g., human) in need thereof. In certain embodiments, such methods comprise administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a nucleic acid-lipid particle comprising one or more siRNA molecules described herein {e.g., as described in Tables A and B) that target HBV gene expression. Examples of symptoms associated with HBV and/or HDV infection in a human include fever, abdominal pain, dark urine, joint pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, weakness, fatigue and yellowing of the skin (jaundice).
In further aspects, HBV and/or HDV may be inactivated in a mammal (e.g., human) in need thereof {e.g., a human suffering from HBV infection or HBV/HDV infection), the method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a nucleic acid- lipid particle comprising one or more siRNAs described herein that target HBV gene expression. In some embodiments, administration of nucleic acid-lipid particles comprising one or more HBV-targeting siRNAs lowers, reduces, or decreases HBV protein levels {e.g., HBV surface antigen protein) by at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% (or any range therein) relative to the HBV protein levels detected in the absence of the siRNA {e.g., buffer control or irrelevant non-HBV targeting siRNA control).
By way of example, HBV mRNA can be measured using a branched DNA assay (QuantiGene®; Affymetrix). The branched DNA assay is a sandwich nucleic acid hybridization method that uses bDNA molecules to amplify signal from captured target RNA.
In addition to its utility in silencing the expression of any of the HBV genes for therapeutic purposes, the siRNA described herein are also useful in research and development applications as well as diagnostic, prophylactic, prognostic, clinical, and other healthcare applications. As a non-limiting example, the siRNA can be used in target validation studies directed at testing whether a specific member of the HBV gene family has the potential to be a therapeutic target.
Administration of Lipid Particles
Once formed, the lipid particles of the invention are particularly useful for the introduction of a siRNA molecule (e.g., a siRNA molecule as described in Tables A and B) into cells. Accordingly, the present invention also provides methods for introducing a siRNA molecule into a cell. In particular embodiments, the siRNA molecule is introduced into an infected cell. The methods may be carried out in vitro or in vivo by first forming the particles as described above and then contacting the particles with the cells for a period of time sufficient for delivery of siRNA to the cells to occur.
The lipid particles of the invention (e.g., a nucleic-acid lipid particle) can be adsorbed to almost any cell type with which they are mixed or contacted. Once adsorbed, the particles can either be endocytosed by a portion of the cells, exchange lipids with cell membranes, or fuse with the cells. Transfer or incorporation of the siRNA portion of the particle can take place via any one of these pathways. In particular, when fusion takes place, the particle membrane is integrated into the cell membrane and the contents of the particle combine with the intracellular fluid.
The lipid particles of the invention (e.g., nucleic acid-lipid particles) can be administered either alone or in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., physiological saline or phosphate buffer) selected in accordance with the route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Generally, normal buffered saline (e.g., 135-150 mM NaCl) will be employed as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers include, e.g., water, buffered water, 0.4% saline, 0.3% glycine, and the like, including glycoproteins for enhanced stability, such as albumin, lipoprotein, globulin, etc. Additional suitable carriers are described in, e.g. , REMINGTON' S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, Mack Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 17th ed. (1985). As used herein, "carrier" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, vehicles, coatings, diluents, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, buffers, carrier solutions, suspensions, colloids, and the like. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction when administered to a human.
The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is generally added following lipid particle formation. Thus, after the lipid particle is formed, the particle can be diluted into
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as normal buffered saline. The concentration of particles in the pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.05%, usually at or at least about 2 to 5%, to as much as about 10 to 90% by weight, and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc. , in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected. For example, the concentration may be increased to lower the fluid load associated with treatment. This may be particularly desirable in patients having atherosclerosis-associated congestive heart failure or severe hypertension. Alternatively, particles composed of irritating lipids may be diluted to low concentrations to lessen
inflammation at the site of administration.
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be sterilized by conventional, well-known sterilization techniques. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration. The compositions can contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride. Additionally, the particle suspension may include lipid-protective agents which protect lipids against free-radical and lipid-peroxidative damages on storage. Lipophilic free-radical quenchers, such as alphatocopherol, and water-soluble iron-specific chelators, such as ferrioxamine, are suitable.
In some embodiments, the lipid particles of the invention are particularly useful in methods for the therapeutic delivery of one or more siRNA molecules {e.g. , an siRNA molecule as described in Tables A and B). In particular, it is an object of this invention to provide in vivo methods for treatment of HBV and/or HDV infection in humans by downregulating or silencing the transcription and/or translation of one or more HBV genes.
A. In vivo Administration
Systemic delivery for in vivo therapy, e.g. , delivery of a siRNA molecule described herein, such as an siRNA described in Tables A and B, to a distal target cell via body systems such as the circulation, has been achieved using nucleic acid-lipid particles such as those described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 05/007196, WO 05/121348, WO 05/120152, and WO 04/002453, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. The present invention also provides fully encapsulated lipid particles that protect the siRNA from nuclease degradation in serum, are non-immunogenic, are small in size, and are suitable for repeat dosing. Additionally, the one or more siRNA molecules may be administered alone in the lipid particles of the invention, or in combination (e.g., co-administered) with lipid particles comprising peptides, polypeptides, or small molecules such as conventional drugs.
For in vivo administration, administration can be in any manner known in the art, e.g., by injection, oral administration, inhalation (e.g. , intranasal or intratracheal), transdermal application, or rectal administration. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses. The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered parenterally, i.e., intraarticularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by a bolus injection (see, e.g. , U.S. Patent No. 5,286,634). Intracellular nucleic acid delivery has also been discussed in Straubringer et al. , Methods Enzymol. , 101 :512 (1983); Mannino et al. ,
Biotechniques, 6:682 (1988); Nicolau et al, Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Sy St., 6:239 (1989); and Behr, Acc. Chem. Res., 26:274 (1993). Still other methods of administering lipid-based therapeutics are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,993,754; 4, 145,410; 4,235,871 ; 4,224, 179; 4,522,803; and 4,588,578. The lipid particles can be administered by direct injection at the site of disease or by injection at a site distal from the site of disease (see, e.g., Culver, HUMAN GENE THERAPY, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Publishers, New York. pp.70-71(1994)). The disclosures of the above-described references are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
In embodiments where the lipid particles of the present invention are administered intravenously, at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25% of the total injected dose of the particles is present in plasma about 8, 12, 24, 36, or 48 hours after injection. In other embodiments, more than about 20%, 30%, 40% and as much as about 60%, 70% or 80% of the total injected dose of the lipid particles is present in plasma about 8, 12, 24, 36, or 48 hours after injection. In certain instances, more than about 10% of a plurality of the particles is present in the plasma of a mammal about 1 hour after administration. In certain other instances, the presence of the lipid particles is detectable at least about 1 hour after administration of the particle. In some embodiments, the presence of a siRNA molecule is detectable in cells at about 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 or 96 hours after administration. In other embodiments, downregulation of expression of a target sequence, such as a viral or host sequence, by a siRNA molecule is detectable at about 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 or 96 hours after administration. In yet other embodiments, downregulation of expression of a target sequence, such as a viral or host sequence, by a siRNA molecule occurs preferentially in infected cells and/or cells capable of being infected. In further embodiments, the presence or effect of a siRNA molecule in cells at a site proximal or distal to the site of administration is detectable at about 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours, or at about 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, or 28 days after administration. In additional embodiments, the lipid particles of the invention are administered parenterally or intraperitoneally.
The compositions of the present invention, either alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations (i.e., they can be "nebulized") to be administered via inhalation (e.g. , intranasally or intratracheally) (see, Brigham et al. , Am. J. Sci., 298:278 (1989)). Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like.
In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions may be delivered by intranasal sprays, inhalation, and/or other aerosol delivery vehicles. Methods for delivering nucleic acid compositions directly to the lungs via nasal aerosol sprays have been described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,756,353 and 5,804,212. Likewise, the delivery of drugs using intranasal microparticle resins and lysophosphatidyl -glycerol compounds (U.S. Patent
5,725,871) are also well-known in the pharmaceutical arts. Similarly, transmucosal drug delivery in the form of a polytetrafluoroetheylene support matrix is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,780,045. The disclosures of the above-described patents are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration, such as, for example, by intraarticular (in the joints), intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous routes, include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. In the practice of this invention, compositions are preferably administered, for example, by intravenous infusion, orally, topically, intraperitoneally, intravesically, or intrathecally.
Generally, when administered intravenously, the lipid particle formulations are formulated with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. Many pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be employed in the compositions and methods of the present invention. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found, for example, in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, Mack Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 17th ed. (1985). A variety of aqueous carriers may be used, for example, water, buffered water, 0.4% saline, 0.3%> glycine, and the like, and may include glycoproteins for enhanced stability, such as albumin, lipoprotein, globulin, etc. Generally, normal buffered saline (135-150 mM NaCl) will be employed as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, but other suitable carriers will suffice. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional liposomal sterilization techniques, such as filtration. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanol amine oleate, etc. These compositions can be sterilized using the techniques referred to above or, alternatively, they can be produced under sterile conditions. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration.
In certain applications, the lipid particles disclosed herein may be delivered via oral administration to the individual. The particles may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, pills, lozenges, elixirs, mouthwash, suspensions, oral sprays, syrups, wafers, and the like {see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,641,515, 5,580,579, and 5,792,451, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes). These oral dosage forms may also contain the following: binders, gelatin; excipients, lubricants, and/or flavoring agents. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to the materials described above, a liquid carrier. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed.
Typically, these oral formulations may contain at least about 0.1% of the lipid particles or more, although the percentage of the particles may, of course, be varied and may
conveniently be between about 1% or 2% and about 60% or 70% or more of the weight or volume of the total formulation. Naturally, the amount of particles in each therapeutically useful composition may be prepared is such a way that a suitable dosage will be obtained in any given unit dose of the compound. Factors such as solubility, bioavailability, biological half-life, route of administration, product shelf life, as well as other pharmacological considerations will be contemplated by one skilled in the art of preparing such pharmaceutical formulations, and as such, a variety of dosages and treatment regimens may be desirable.
Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist of: (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of a packaged siRNA molecule {e.g., a siRNA molecule described in Tables A and B) suspended in diluents such as water, saline, or PEG 400; (b) capsules, sachets, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of a siRNA molecule, as liquids, solids, granules, or gelatin; (c) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (d) suitable emulsions. Tablet forms can include one or more of lactose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, calcium phosphates, corn starch, potato starch, microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, fillers, binders, diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, dyes, disintegrating agents, and pharmaceutically compatible carriers. Lozenge forms can comprise a siRNA molecule in a flavor, e.g., sucrose, as well as pastilles comprising the therapeutic nucleic acid in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia emulsions, gels, and the like containing, in addition to the siRNA molecule, carriers known in the art.
In another example of their use, lipid particles can be incorporated into a broad range of topical dosage forms. For instance, a suspension containing nucleic acid-lipid particles can be formulated and administered as gels, oils, emulsions, topical creams, pastes, ointments, lotions, foams, mousses, and the like.
When preparing pharmaceutical preparations of the lipid particles of the invention, it is preferable to use quantities of the particles which have been purified to reduce or eliminate empty particles or particles with therapeutic agents such as siRNA associated with the external surface.
The methods of the present invention may be practiced in a variety of hosts. Preferred hosts include mammalian species, such as primates (e.g. , humans and chimpanzees as well as other nonhuman primates), canines, felines, equines, bovines, ovines, caprines, rodents (e.g., rats and mice), lagomorphs, and swine.
The amount of particles administered will depend upon the ratio of siRNA molecules to lipid, the particular siRNA used, the strain of HBV being treated, the age, weight, and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the clinician, but will generally be between about 0.01 and about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight, preferably between about 0.1 and about 5 mg/kg of body weight, or about 108-1010 particles per administration (e.g., injection).
B. In vitro Administration
For in vitro applications, the delivery of siRNA molecules can be to any cell grown in culture. In preferred embodiments, the cells are animal cells, more preferably mammalian cells, and most preferably human cells.
Contact between the cells and the lipid particles, when carried out in vitro, takes place in a biologically compatible medium. The concentration of particles varies widely depending on the particular application, but is generally between about 1 μιτιοΐ and about 10 mmol. Treatment of the cells with the lipid particles is generally carried out at physiological temperatures (about 37°C) for periods of time of from about 1 to 48 hours, preferably of from about 2 to 4 hours.
In one group of preferred embodiments, a lipid particle suspension is added to 60-80% confluent plated cells having a cell density of from about 103 to about 105 cells/ml, more preferably about 2 x 104 cells/ml. The concentration of the suspension added to the cells is preferably of from about 0.01 to 0.2 μg/ml, more preferably about 0.1 μg/ml.
To the extent that tissue culture of cells may be required, it is well-known in the art. For example, Freshney, Culture of Animal Cells, a Manual of Basic Technique, 3rd Ed., Wiley - Liss, New York (1994), Kuchler et al, Biochemical Methods in Cell Culture and Virology, Dowden, Hutchinson and Ross, Inc. (1977), and the references cited therein provide a general guide to the culture of cells. Cultured cell systems often will be in the form of monolayers of cells, although cell suspensions are also used.
Using an Endosomal Release Parameter (ERP) assay, the delivery efficiency of a nucleic acid-lipid particle of the invention can be optimized. An ERP assay is described in detail in U. S. Patent Publication No. 20030077829, the disclosure of which is herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. More particularly, the purpose of an ERP assay is to distinguish the effect of various cationic lipids and helper lipid components of the lipid particle based on their relative effect on binding/uptake or fusion with/destabilization of the endosomal membrane. This assay allows one to determine quantitatively how each component of the lipid particle affects delivery efficiency, thereby optimizing the lipid particle. Usually, an ERP assay measures expression of a reporter protein {e.g., luciferase, β- galactosidase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), etc.), and in some instances, a lipid particle formulation optimized for an expression plasmid will also be appropriate for encapsulating a siRNA. In other instances, an ERP assay can be adapted to measure downregulation of transcription or translation of a target sequence in the presence or absence of a siRNA. By comparing the ERPs for each of the various lipid particles, one can readily determine the optimized system, e.g., the lipid particle that has the greatest uptake in the cell.
C. Detection of Lipid Particles
In some embodiments, the lipid particles of the present invention are detectable in the subject at about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more hours. In other embodiments, the lipid particles of the present invention are detectable in the subject at about 8, 12, 24, 48, 60, 72, or 96 hours, or about 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, or 28 days after administration of the particles. The presence of the particles can be detected in the cells, tissues, or other biological samples from the subject. The particles may be detected, e.g. , by direct detection of the particles, detection of a siRNA sequence, detection of the target sequence of interest (i.e., by detecting expression or reduced expression of the sequence of interest), detection of a compound modulated by an EBOV protein (e.g., interferon), detection of viral load in the subject, or a combination thereof.
1. Detection of Particles
Lipid particles of the invention can be detected using any method known in the art.
For example, a label can be coupled directly or indirectly to a component of the lipid particle using methods well-known in the art. A wide variety of labels can be used, with the choice of label depending on sensitivity required, ease of conjugation with the lipid particle component, stability requirements, and available instrumentation and disposal provisions. Suitable labels include, but are not limited to, spectral labels such as fluorescent dyes (e.g., fluorescein and derivatives, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Oregon Green™; rhodamine and derivatives such Texas red, tetrarhodimine isothiocynate (TRITC), etc., digoxigenin, biotin, phycoerythrin, AMCA, CyDyes™, and the like; radiolabels such as 3H, 1251, 35S, 14C, 32P, 33P, etc.; enzymes such as horse radish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, etc.; spectral colorimetnc labels such as colloidal gold or colored glass or plastic beads such as polystyrene,
polypropylene, latex, etc. The label can be detected using any means known in the art.
2. Detection of Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids (e.g., siRNA molecules) are detected and quantified herein by any of a number of means well-known to those of skill in the art. The detection of nucleic acids may proceed by well-known methods such as Southern analysis, Northern analysis, gel
electrophoresis, PCR, radiolabeling, scintillation counting, and affinity chromatography.
Additional analytic biochemical methods such as spectrophotometry, radiography,
electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), and hyperdiffusion chromatography may also be employed.
The selection of a nucleic acid hybridization format is not critical. A variety of nucleic acid hybridization formats are known to those skilled in the art. For example, common formats include sandwich assays and competition or displacement assays. Hybridization techniques are generally described in, e.g., "Nucleic Acid Hybridization, A Practical Approach," Eds. Hames and Higgins, IRL Press (1985).
The sensitivity of the hybridization assays may be enhanced through the use of a nucleic acid amplification system which multiplies the target nucleic acid being detected. In vitro amplification techniques suitable for amplifying sequences for use as molecular probes or for generating nucleic acid fragments for subsequent subcloning are known. Examples of techniques sufficient to direct persons of skill through such in vitro amplification methods, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the ligase chain reaction (LCR), QP-replicase amplification, and other RNA polymerase mediated techniques (e.g., NASBA™) are found in Sambrook et al., n Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (2000); and Ausubel et al , SHORT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, eds., Current Protocols, Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (2002); as well as U. S. Patent No. 4,683,202; PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications (Innis et al. eds.) Academic Press Inc. San Diego, CA (1990); Arnheim & Levinson (October 1, 1990), C&EN 36; The Journal Of NIH Research, 3 :81 (1991); Kwoh et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86: 1 173 (1989); Guatelli et al , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87: 1874 (1990); Lomell et al, J. Clin. Chem., 35: 1826 (1989); Landegren et al , Science, 241 Α01Ί (1988); Van Brunt,
Biotechnology, 8:291 (1990); Wu and Wallace, Gene, 4:560 (1989); Barringer et al , Gene, 89: 1 17 (1990); and Sooknanan and Malek, Biotechnology, 13 :563 (1995). Improved methods of cloning in vitro amplified nucleic acids are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,426,039. Other methods described in the art are the nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA™, Cangene, Mississauga, Ontario) and QP-replicase systems. These systems can be used to directly identify mutants where the PCR or LCR primers are designed to be extended or ligated only when a select sequence is present. Alternatively, the select sequences can be generally amplified using, for example, nonspecific PCR primers and the amplified target region later probed for a specific sequence indicative of a mutation. The disclosures of the above-described references are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
Nucleic acids for use as probes, e.g., in in vitro amplification methods, for use as gene probes, or as inhibitor components are typically synthesized chemically according to the solid phase phosphoramidite triester method described by Beaucage et al, Tetrahedron Letts., 22: 1859 1862 (1981), e.g., using an automated synthesizer, as described in Needham
VanDevanter et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 12:6159 (1984). Purification of polynucleotides, where necessary, is typically performed by either native acrylamide gel electrophoresis or by anion exchange HPLC as described in Pearson et al, J. Chrom., 255: 137 149 (1983). The sequence of the synthetic polynucleotides can be verified using the chemical degradation method of Maxam and Gilbert (1980) in Grossman and Moldave (eds.) Academic Press, New York, Methods in Enzymology, 65:499.
An alternative means for determining the level of transcription is in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization assays are well-known and are generally described in Angerer et al , Methods Enzymol., 152:649 (1987). In an in situ hybridization assay, cells are fixed to a solid support, typically a glass slide. If DNA is to be probed, the cells are denatured with heat or alkali. The cells are then contacted with a hybridization solution at a moderate temperature to permit annealing of specific probes that are labeled. The probes are preferably labeled with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters.
Embodiments of Certain Conjugates
As described herein, an HBV antigen inhibitor may be an oligonucleotide, such as an siRNA molecule. Such molecules (e.g., as described in Tables A and B) may be conjugated to a targeting moiety. For example, in certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide (e.g., siRNA molecule) may be comprised within a compound of formula I or XX.
Accordingly, in one aspect an oligonucleotide is comprised within a compound of formula I:
(I)
wherein:
R1 a is targeting ligand;
L1 is absent or a linking group;
L2 is absent or a linking group;

Certain Definitions for Conjugate Embodiments
The term "synthetic activating group" refers to a group that can be attached to an atom to activate that atom to allow it to form a covalent bond with another reactive group. It is understood that the nature of the synthetic activating group may depend on the atom that it is activating. For example, when the synthetic activating group is attached to an oxygen atom, the synthetic activating group is a group that will activate that oxygen atom to form a bond (e.g. an ester, carbamate, or ether bond) with another reactive group. Such synthetic activating groups are known. Examples of synthetic activating groups that can be attached to an oxygen atom include, but are not limited to, acetate, succinate, triflate, and mesylate. When the synthetic activating group is attached to an oxygen atom of a carboxylic acid, the synthetic activating group can be a group that is derivable from a known coupling reagent (e.g. a known amide coupling reagent).

Formulation and Administration of Conjugates and/or Additional Therapeutic Agents
The agents (i.e., conjugates and additional therapeutic agents) can be formulated for and administered using any acceptable route of administration depending on the agent selected. For example, suitable routes include, but are not limited to, oral, sublingual, buccal, topical, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration.
When a combination of agents is administered, it will be understood that the agents can be formulated together in a single preparation or that they can be formulated separately and, thus, administered separately, either simultaneously or sequentially. In one embodiment, when the agents are administered sequentially (e.g. at different times), the agents may be administered so that their biological effects overlap (i.e. each agent is producing a biological effect at a single given time).
The agents can be individually formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may typically range anywhere from about 3 to about 8. The agents ordinarily will be stored as a solid composition, although lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions are acceptable.
Compositions comprising the agents can be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular human being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of administration, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners
The agents may be administered in any convenient administrative form, e.g., tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, sprays, suppositories, gels, emulsions, patches, etc. Such compositions may contain components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., diluents, carriers, pH modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and further active agents. If parenteral administration is desired, the compositions will be sterile and in a solution or suspension form suitable for injection or infusion.
Suitable carriers and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in detail in, e.g., Ansel, Howard C, et al., Ansel' s Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2004; Gennaro, Alfonso R., et al. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and Rowe, Raymond C. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients. Chicago, Pharmaceutical Press, 2005. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents, diluents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).
The agents are typically dosed at least at a level to reach the desired biological effect. Thus, an effective dosing regimen will dose at least a minimum amount that reaches the desired biological effect, or biologically effective dose, however, the dose should not be so high as to outweigh the benefit of the biological effect with unacceptable side effects. Therefore, an effective dosing regimen will dose no more than the maximum tolerated dose ("MTD"). The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose that produces an acceptable incidence of dose-limiting toxicities ("DLT"). Doses that cause an unacceptable rate of DLT are considered non-tolerated. Typically, the MTD for a particular schedule is established in phase 1 clinical trials. These are usually conducted in patients by starting at a safe starting dose of 1/10 the severe toxic dose ("STD10") in rodents (on a mg/m^ basis) and accruing patients in cohorts of three, escalating the dose according to a modified Fibonacci sequence in which ever higher escalation steps have ever decreasing relative increments (e.g., dose increases of 100%, 65%, 50%, 40%, and 30% to 35% thereafter). The dose escalation is continued in cohorts of three patients until a non-tolerated dose is reached. The next lower dose level that produces an acceptable rate of DLT is considered to be the MTD.
The amount of the agents administered will depend upon the particular agent used, the strain of HBV being treated, the age, weight, and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the clinician, but will generally be between about 0.2 to 2.0 grams per day.
Kits
The present invention also provides kits comprising:
a) an HBV antigen inhibitor; b) instructions for administering the inhibitor to a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patient determined to have a C/C genotype at rsl2079860.
In certain embodiments the HBV antigen inhibitor is an oligonucleotide (e.g., an siRNA). In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide is comprised within a lipid nanoparticle formulation. Thus, the present invention also provides lipid particles in kit form. In some embodiments, the kit comprises a container which is compartmentalized for holding the various elements of the lipid particles (e.g., the active agents, such as siRNA molecules and the individual lipid components of the particles). Preferably, the kit comprises a container (e.g., a vial or ampoule) which holds the lipid particles of the invention, wherein the particles are produced by one of the processes set forth herein. In certain embodiments, the kit may further comprise an endosomal membrane destabilizer (e.g., calcium ions). The kit typically contains the particle compositions of the invention, either as a suspension in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or in dehydrated form, with instructions for their rehydration (if lyophilized) and administration.
The formulations of the present invention can be tailored to preferentially target particular cells, tissues, or organs of interest. Preferential targeting of a nucleic acid-lipid particle may be carried out by controlling the composition of the lipid particle itself. In particular embodiments, the kits of the invention comprise these lipid particles, wherein the particles are present in a container as a suspension or in dehydrated form.
In certain instances, it may be desirable to have a targeting moiety attached to the surface of the lipid particle to further enhance the targeting of the particle. Methods of attaching targeting moieties (e.g., antibodies, proteins, etc.) to lipids (such as those used in the present particles) are known to those of skill in the art.
In certain embodiments, the HBV antigen inhibitor is conjugated to a targeting moiety. Thus, the present invention also provides conjugates described herein in kit form.

Example 29. IL-28B polymorphisms in Chronic Hepatitis B subjects
Study Goal
Several host and viral factors have been found to be associated with differences in HBV clearance or persistence. However, an unexplained variability in treatment outcome still exists, suggesting that the genetic background of the host plays an important role. The literature surrounding the impact of certain SNPs on chronic HBV infection is currently somewhat controversial and not consistent. For example, some groups have found significant correlations between certain SNPs and different responses to PEGylated-interferon (peglFN) by chronic
HBV HBeAg-negative patients. Other groups have looked for, but failed to identify statistically significant correlations.
siRNA-NP2, described below, is an HBV antigen inhibitor having a novel mechanism of action against HBV, which is distinct from that of IFN. With this novel mechanism of action, the correlation between certain SNPs and treatment response to siRNA-NP2 may be stronger or clearer than in the previous studies examining IFN. Thus, the goal of this study was to determinate whether IL-28B polymorphisms play a role in subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) receiving an HBV antigen inhibitor (e.g., an INF free therapy), such as the siRNA-NP2 formulation described below. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is hypothesized that individuals with these S Ps have better control of CHB, meaning that even if spontaneous clearance has not yet been achieved, such individuals are closer to reaching the 'tipping point' needed to assert dominant control over the virus. Hepatitis B virus utilizes multiple mechanisms to enforce chronicity of infection, including maintaining high levels of antigen production that are thought to play roles in suppression of host immune responses, amongst other things. In patients with SNPs in, e.g., IL28B, the virus may be less able to upregulate gene expression to compensate for the gene silencing effect of siRNA-NP2, and so therefore, the gene silencing effect of siRNA-NP2 is more clearly detectable in this subset of patients.
Lipid Nanoparticle Formulation
The following formulation is an RNA interference product that includes three synthetic double-stranded, small interfering RNAs directed against hepatitis B virus (HBV) messenger RNAs, targeting three distinct sites in the HBV genome. This combination of siRNAs is designed to inhibit viral replication, reduce all HBV transcripts, and lower all viral antigens.
The lipid nanoparticle formulation comprises a mixture of three siRNAs targeting the HBV genome {see, siRNA listed below) Specifically, the following lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation was used to deliver the HBV siRNAs in the experiments reported herein. This formulation is referred to as siRNA-NP2 throughout this Example.
Abbreviations: qs = quantum satus; USP-NF = United States Pharmacopoeia-National
Formulary.
A mixture of three siRNAs targeting the HBV genome were used in this experiment. The sequences of the three siRNAs are shown below.
Methods
The study was a single-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose study in non-cirrhotic, virally suppressed subjects to evaluate safety and efficacy of siRNA-NP2 initially over 12 weeks in cohorts 1, 2 and 3. Cohort 4 was used to evaluated the safety, PK and anti -viral response of a more frequent dosing regimen (five bi-weekly doses of siRNA-NP2 with extended monthly dosing out to one year for patients who meet predefined response criteria).
A total of 24 subjects on stable nucleoside therapy were enrolled in the initial 3 cohorts, randomized 3 : 1 (active vs placebo): Cohort 1, HBeAg(-) at 0.2 mg/kg; Cohort 2, HBeAg(-) at 0.4 mg/kg; Cohort 3, HBeAg(+) at 0.4 mg kg. Subjects received siRNA-NP2 as 3 monthly IV doses.
Cohort 4 was an open label multi-dose study in non-cirrhotic HBeAg (-) virally suppressed subjects. A total of 12 subjects on stable nucleoside therapy were enrolled to receive siRNA-NP2 0.4 mg/kg bi-weekly for a total of five doses over 8 weeks. Subjects with HBsAg <1000 RJ/mL AND >1.0 logio decrease from baseline at Day 71 continued with up to 10 additional monthly doses for a total treatment duration of 48 weeks. Subjects were monitored for safety, PK and HBV markers, and HBV genotype was assessed by line probe assay (ΓΝΝΟ- LiPA; Innogenetics N.V., Ghent, Belgium).
The IL-28B associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rsl2979860 (chr.
19ql3), was analyzed using a real-time PCR assay. The assay utilized the 5-prime nuclease activity of a thermostable polymerase and unique primers and fluorescent probes to detect the SNP (rsl2979860 C/T) in whole blood samples for subjects enrolled on cohort 4. Results and Conclusion
Of 12 subjects, 9 (75%) were male, having a mean age of 48.3 years. Eight of the subjects had the 8 IL28B genotype CC (66%), 8 had HBV genotype C (66%) and the mean baseline HBsAg was 3.43 (logio IU/mL) (Tablel). Eleven subjects completed 5 doses of siR A- NP2 0.4 mg/kg. All subjects experienced a reduction in HBsAg from baseline. Seven of 11 (64%) subjects were considered responders prior to or at Day 71; 5/7 (71%) subjects met the criteria by Day 22 (2 doses). Mean HBsAg decline for responders was -1.6 loglO IU/mL at treatment Day 64 with a maximum individual HBsAg decline -2.7 loglO IU/mL; in addition, 5/7 (71%)) responders reached HBsAg< 50 IU/mL. Based on this data, it is suggested that the CC genotype for SNP rs 12979860 is indicative of a patients demonstrating a higher likelihood of showing a significant response to siRNA-NP2.
